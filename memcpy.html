<b>Memcpy</b>

memcpy is a standard library function in C that copies a specified number of bytes from a
source memory location to a destination memory location. It is commonly used for copying
blocks of memory, such as arrays or structures. The function operates quickly but has a
limitation: it assumes that the source and destination memory regions do not overlap.

If there is overlap, the behavior is undefined, which can lead to corrupted data.
In contrast, memmove also copies a specified number of bytes from a source to a destination,
but it is designed to handle overlapping memory regions safely. It ensures that the copy
operation completes correctly even if the source and destination areas overlap.
This makes memmove more versatile, though potentially slightly slower than
memcpy due to the additional checks it performs. Assume we initialize boxes, e.g.

Box | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
Data| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

when trying to move boxes or a region of to some other region w/ memcpy, it can lead
to this overlap situation we see here...

Box | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
Data| 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 7 |

In other words, we were trying to copy the original  Box 1-3  (4 boxes) to  Box 3-7 (5 spaces)
however we did not handle the overlap, and so the corruption occurred where Box 1 moves
to Box 3, overwriting the original data in Box 3;  Box 2 gets moved to Box 4, overwriting
Box 4's data. And Box 3 (now holding data 1 from Box 1) moves to Box 5, overwriting the
original data in Box 5.

Obviously you dont want this kindve staggered behaviorâ€”which'll happen if the source
and destination regions are overlapping. In a typical "move" operation, the first box that
is moved goes to the target location that would best align with the destination (without
overwriting existing data). Also, if you're copying from one part of memory to another
part that overlaps, it's better to use a temporary buffer to hold the data you need to
move first. This way, you can copy the data in the correct order without corruption.

Otherwise you should use `memmove` or, `safe_copy` which is a user-implemented version
of memcpy that takes advantage of a secure data type `rsize_t` (which provides context
about the size/boundaries of memory regions) and which is safer to use. And when properly
implemented it can be used for this overlapping memory situation that we discussed.

for simplicity, let's just copy a subset of the source buffer.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define BUFFER_SIZE 7

  void resizeVideo(int *source, int srcWidth, int *dest, int destWidth) {
    memcpy(dest, source, sizeof(int) * destWidth);
  }

  int main() {
    int sourceBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int destinationBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    int sourceWidth = BUFFER_SIZE;
    int destWidth = BUFFER_SIZE;

    int scalingFactor = 1;

    if (scalingFactor == 1) {</span>
        <em>// Directly copy the content from sourceBuffer to destinationBuffer</em><span class="alt-text">
        memcpy(destinationBuffer, sourceBuffer, sizeof(int) * destWidth);
    } else {
       </span><em>// Resize the video (in this example, copy a subset of the source buffer)</em><span class="alt-text">
        resizeVideo(sourceBuffer, sourceWidth, destinationBuffer, destWidth);
    }</span>

    <em>// Print the content of destinationBuffer</em><span class="alt-text">
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; BUFFER_SIZE; i++) {
        printf("%d, ", destinationBuffer[i]);
    }

    printf("\n");
    return 0;
  }</span>

In this example, `memcpy` is used when the scaling factor is 1 to copy the
entire content of `sourceBuffer` to `destinationBuffer`; Two separate buffers
means we wont have any overlap because they are two separate arrays. Continuing on,
if the scaling factor is different, a hypothetical `resizeVideo` function is called
to perform some resizing operation; In this case, just copying a subset of the source buffer,
and thats the gist of what this code does, and something you can think about when working w/ memcpy.
