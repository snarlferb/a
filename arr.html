<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[3];</span>

If `int arr[3] = ...`, were to equal something then we could gain access
and receive a normal integer value when specifying its index.

otherwise the index of an array is random when uninitialized or its being
determined by the initializer e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[] = {3, 4, 5};</span>

The size of our array is just the amount of said elements, the 0th element being
the first number or character.

Speaking of which, we can also create individual characters and access the third
element, or whichever you want, like so <em>(note: `{...}` is the initializer list)</em>
<span class="alt-text">
  char arr[3] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};</span>

Continuing on, the next example will assign (5) however its not an array (not directly
storing the number 5). That is, an "un-parenthesized" single character, not quoted, is
treated as an integer and stores the character's ASCII code:
<span class="alt-text">
  char exp = 5;</span>

"5" in ASCII corresponds to ENQ (Enquiry) control character. Control character's
ASCII values are found within the inclusive range of  0—31. "32" is the space
character '  ', and ASCII values 33—126 are various printable symbols,
numbers, letters, and punctuation marks. Note, there are ASCII values
after 126 that are not part of the standard 7-bit ASCII table.

Another way to store a character's ASCII code
<span class="alt-text">
  char exp = '\a';</span>

Characters like '\a' which represents the alert (bell), '\n' (newline), and '\t' (tab)
are part of a set of escape sequences in C that map to specific ASCII control characters.

The following is referring to the character constant, or character literal 'a'
<span class="alt-text">
  char exp = 'a';</span>

single quotes (') are used for character constants. They represent a single character,
even if you put multiple characters within them.

character literals (like `char exp = 5`)  represents a single, unchanging value.
For example, the character literal 'a' always corresponds to the ASCII value 97,
and as such this value is constant and will never change.

double quotes (") are used for string literals. They represent a sequence of characters,
including spaces and special characters.

In C, character variables are treated as a type of integer, often signed integers
(they can hold both positive and negative values). when you assign, ` e.g. char exp = 0xFF `.
Compilers and modern systems tend to treat char as signed by default.

The actual value stored depends on whether char is signed or unsigned.

If char is signed, the upper bit (most significant bit) of 0xFF is interpreted as a
sign bit (1 for negative). This can result in a negative value depending on the
system's implementation.  if char is unsigned, all 8 bits of 0xFF are used to
represent the value, resulting in 255 decimal number.

In conclusion, you can see that there's quite the amount of variation when it
comes to characters and arrays. and we still havent shown string literals:
<span class="alt-text">
  char str[] = "abc";</span>

character arrays, specifically strings, are null-terminated, which means that
an additional null character (\0) is  implicitly  added at the end of the
initialized elements, even if you don't explicitly include it to the initializer list.
<span class="alt-text">
  char element = str[2];</span>

We could modify a string, e.g. `element[2] = 'W'` or something, or we could declare,
and later assign a pointer we also declared, to it, like `ptr = element`. As long
as you modify the array, not the literal pointed to, its safe and legal, given that
string literals are <b>read-only</b>. That means, if you store a string literal in a pointer, modifying directly = undefined behavior!

`\0` (Null character or NUL) is a single character literal in C represented by \0.
It is essentially the ASCII character with the value 0 (zero). In string literals,
(\0) denotes the null-terminating character, which signifies the end of a string

NULL on the other hand is a macro defined in several standard C libraries
(typically as (void *)0). It is used primarily to represent a null pointer, that
does not point to any object or function. It's commonly used in pointer contexts
to signify that the pointer does not currently refer to any valid memory location.
Returning to array declaration,
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[3];</span>

The name "arr" itself represents the address of the first element of the array.
In other words its equivalent to a pointer to the first element of the array.
Therefore, you can simply use the array name `arr` to point to the array...
<span class="alt-text">
  int *ptr = arr;</span>

`int arr[3]` is considered an <b>integer array</b>, `int[]` with the name "arr"
of size (3)... As such its created a pointer to the integer named "arr"
(a contiguous block of memory with (3) integers). However if we had declared
`int *` (a pointer variable w/ the address of an integer) this would change
what we could do with it.

We could use the integer array to point to an array, or it could be used for
dynamically allocating memory w/ a variable-size array (which we explain below)

while we have an array we can also declare a pointer to an array of an
unspecified size, cause why not. we're showing all possible entrees you can serve,
<span class="alt-text">
  int (*ptr)[];</span>

the compiler needs to know how big each array is, so you wouldnt just have an empty index.
still, now that you know the anatomy, you can decompose this to cast it — in this case,
to a `NULL`, that which is in the place of the <b>variable</b> you would cast it to...
<span class="alt-text">
  ptr_cast = (int (*)[])NULL;</span>

or you can allocate memory for n arrays of e.g. "3" integers each:
<span class="alt-text">
  int (*ptr)[3] = malloc(n * sizeof(*ptr));</span>

note: in all cases there is implicit conversion, of malloc (void *malloc) to int,
or any type its being assigned to, so you dont need an explicit cast to it.
this is for all types, except when assigning a function pointer.
<span class="alt-text">
  void (*func_ptr)() = (void (*)())malloc(sizeof(void (*)()));</span> // Correct

sizeof() is a special operator in C that evaluates to the size (in bytes)
of a given type or expression. Therefore it is useful for determining memory
requirements, especially for arrays and structures, without executing code at runtime.
Since it returns a value of type  size_t , it can be used in expressions and function arguments.

if all that is too confusing, you can reserve it for later
we'll be explaining malloc in more depth (or you can find the dedicated page <a class="reserve" href="malloc.html">here</a>)

When we write sizeof(*ptr), we're getting the size of the object that `ptr`
points to (hence the asterisk next to `ptr`). And since `ptr` is a pointer
to an array of 3 integers:  int[3],  sizeof(*ptr)  correctly allocates memory—
the right size—for said array of arrays—a 2D array, w/ the memory required to store 3 ints.

Without sizeof, the expression in malloc() would not allocate the correct amount of memory. 
Now, returning back to our valuable array to review what we've learned so far,
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[3];</span>

We can conclude that theres a difference between indexing, accessing and
initializing. in the expression arr[3], the "3" is sometimes called the "subscript".

The term "subscript" is used to describe the index or indices that are used
to access a specific element of an array.

In C99 and newer, C allows you to declare arrays with a size that isn’t known at
compile time, but is known at runtime. These are called VLAs — Variable Length Arrays.

Unlike static arrays (which need a fixed size), VLAs can be created using a variable, as long as:
(A) It’s inside a function (i.e., local scope)
(B) The size variable is available and valid when the array is created

Global arrays need their size known at compile time. You can only use literal constants or macros here.
This is a bit nuanced to explain, so lets go through which examples are legal, and which are illegal:
  //int size = 5;
  //int arr[size]; <em>// ❌ ILLEGAL at global scope (not constant)</em>

or in this context:
  //const int SIZE = 5;
  //int arr[SIZE];</span> <em>// ❌ Still ILLEGAL at global scope — `const` isn’t a constant expression in this context</em>

But this is OK:
<span class="alt-text">
  #define SIZE 5
  int arr[SIZE];</span> <em>// ✅ OK: SIZE is a macro (constant expression)</em>

So only <b>macros, numeric literals, or enum constants</b> work for global array sizes:
<span class="alt-text">
  enum { SIZE = 10 };
  int arr[SIZE];</span> <em>// ✅ OK</em>

note: this is specific to <b>global arrays</b>, not global variables in general—which includes everything!
C also allows for arithmetic expressions within the brackets of an array's index:
<span class="alt-text">
  buffer[bytes_read - 1];</span>

<em>this is the case as well for the expression being assigned to.</em>
of course, this isnt something you can do in a global array context,
since it defies the compile-time constants. you can however initialize
a global array using an initializer list, which is a form of assignment
that happens at program startup, i.e.
<span class="alt-text">
  char buffer[10] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};</span>

<b>Compound Literals</b>

Before C99, if you wanted to pass a struct or array to a function, you’d typically need a named variable:
<span class="alt-text">
  int p[] = { 1, 2 };
  func(p);</span>

C99 introduced compound literals to let you skip the variable:
<span class="alt-text">
  func((int[]){ 1, 2 });</span>

You can also declare an array and assign it to the compound literal:
<span class="alt-text">
  int *arr = (int[]){1, 2, 3, 4, 5};</span>

The example above must be a pointer however, as you're assigning the
address of the first element of the temporary array to `arr`. In C,
you cannot assign a normal array to another array (not special to compound literals)

Besides this special situation, they can be of any type (struct and union included,
but NOT void type) as the purpose is to create an anonymous instance `(type UniqName){}`
of a specific type and initialize its members inline, for using immediately.

When calling a function you can have a compound literal as a parameter.
Returning a value can also be a compound literal; Or you can have a compound
literal that recursively initializes arrays or struct members, just
as far as what other areas you can have a compound literal expressed.

Lets take a normal array of type struct w/ two elements (assume we had a struct target defined)
<span class="alt-text">
  struct target arr[2] = {{5}, {10}};</span>

The first int represents `x` and the second `y`. Here's the compound literal version:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct target arr = (struct target){5, 10};</span>

And this is not to be confused w/ designated initializers, which we learn about
<a class="reserve" href="struct.html">on the next page</a>. Alas i thought i would mention it here first, to establish
when you'd want to use them, the main reason being when you want to
initialize specific elements, aggregates of, an array or structure,
and without explicitly initializing every element:
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[5] = {
    [1] = {.a = 1, .b = 2},
    [2] = 3};</span>

`[1] = {.a = 1, .b = 2}`  initializes the element at index 1 of the array to a
struct with (a = 1) and (b = 2)
`[2] = 3`  initializes the element at index 2 of the array to 3.
The remaining elements (indices 0, 3, and 4) will be initialized to 0...
For a struct, youd initialize specific members like so:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct Foo foo = { .a = 1, .b = 2 };</span>

If you've seen enough examples here, you may start to ask yourself, <em>"wait.. what
on earth is the difference between compound literals and designated initializers?"</em>
—Besides the explicit typecast, there doesnt seem to be a difference, does there?

Designated initializers and compound literals are related but distinct concepts.
Designated initializers are about specifying member initialization, compound
literals, as we said before, are about creating temporary objects.

With designated initializers, you have the added bonus that each member will be
initialized to zero. This rule is rooted in the language's rules for object
initialization and applies to arrays of any storage duration. In static or global
arrays all elements are initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized.

only explicitly initialized elements are set, and uninitialized elements are
default-initialized (that is they are set to zero)

according to the C99 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999), section 6.7.8:

  <em>"if there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than there are
  elements or members of an aggregate, the remainder of the aggregate shall be
  initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static storage duration."</em>

also arrays declared at global or static scope are automatically initialized to zero too,
however that is not the case if they are declared within a function and without `static`.

both compound literals and designated initializers were introduced in C99, so you wont
see them in ANSI C. i can see how it might be confusing to have all of these different
versions of C, but here's all you need to know; the core syntax and semantics of C
have remained remarkably stable since C89, so i think you cant go wrong using any
version -from ANSI C and upwards.

ANSI C is of course colloquially used to refer to C89, as ANSI played a big role in creating
the first C standard, but it in turn became an international effort under ISO. Therefore
some consider the term "ANSI C" to be incorrectly used, although its caught on w/ enough ppl

C99 also introduced implicit flexible array declaration, whos purpose is to allocate variable-
length data, specifically associated w/ a struct. It must always be the last element of a given
struct and is declared as an array that has zero elements, e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  int data[];</span> <em>// flexible array member</em>

C89 only let you declare them as `int data[1]`.  Regardless of, any explicit zero use, i.e.
 `int data[0]`  isnt legal in any version of C no matter what.

The arrays we were working with until now were all <em>fixed</em>, wherein their size was
determined at compile time, e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[var] = {a, b, c};</span>

Variable-sized arrays can be created w/ malloc, for example you can create a new array w/
a larger size and copy the existing elements from the old array to the new one, then
continue adding elements:
<span class="alt-text">
  int MaxSize = 5;
  int *FixedArray = (int*)malloc(MaxSize * sizeof(int));</span>

`malloc(MaxSize * sizeof(int))` dynamically allocates memory for an array of MaxSize
integers. `sizeof(int)` is used to determine the size of each integer element in bytes.

`(int*)` is being cast to malloc, assuring that the variable (malloc) is that type as well.
Youll see this alot in C, specifically for type compatibility reasons. The compiler will perform
this conversion implicitly and issue warnings for implicit conversions that could result in data loss...

and `malloc` is just a function w/ a `size_t`(atleast 16bit) parameter.
<span class="alt-text">
  void *malloc(size_t size)</span>

You can learn about <a class="reserve" href="malloc.html">malloc and dynamic memory allocation here</a>.

Now just to give a closing thought on what we learned so far, theres three things that
sound similar but that are distinct. There's variable-sized arrays, which refers to
arrays whose size is determined at runtime, which can include both VLAs (stack-allocated)
and dynamically allocated arrays (heap-allocated). Theres also flexible array declaration.
The flexible array member feature (introduced in C99) allows you to define an array with
no specified size at the end of a struct, which means the size can be determined
dynamically when memory for the struct is allocated.

Last but not least, I want to show an example of a program, to give you something to think on.
Also I think its the inclusive nature of it, that gives it a distinguishable meaning:
<span class="alt-text">
  int getIndex(int param) {
    return param % 5;
  }

  int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int parameter = 7;</span>  <em>// Example parameter for a subsequent argument</em>

    <em>// Assigned array element uses function param, and subsequent return value as index</em><span class="alt-text">
    int result = arr[getIndex(parameter)];

    printf("Value at index %d in array: %d\n", getIndex(parameter), result);

    return 0;
  }</span>

<em>note: that you can have nested function arguments, both w/ return values; the outside function is evaluated after.</em>
7mod5 equals 2 and, following along w/ the rest of the logic, why does it say the array variable's value is "3"?
It was one of the very first things we said about arrays and their unique properties, and should be obvious
you're not counting over twice, but looking at the arrays actual <u>index#2</u>, and the element of that position.
