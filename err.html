In the context of programming, a "memory error" typically refers to an issue related to how
your program manages computer memory. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even
security vulnerabilities.

Segmentation Fault (or segfault) is a common type of error that occurs when a program tries to access
a memory location that it's not allowed to. For example, consider the following;
<span class="alt-text">
  int *ptr = NULL;
  int x = 10;
  </span><em>//*ptr = 20;  Wouldnt be safe yet (undefined behavior)</em><span class="alt-text">
  ptr = &amp;x;
  *ptr = 20;</span> <em>// Now it's safe</em>

Wherein `*ptr=20` wouldve written to a <em>null pointer</em> that we hadnt dereferenced.
It may have contained a garbage value leading to an attempt to write to, or read from an
invalid memory location (resulting in a segmentation fault)

You also have to consider the variable's lifetime and initialization.
When you set a pointer to a valid memory location, at any point during its lifetime,
it becomes safe to dereference it, which means its safe to assign a value to. Dereferencing
a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory location the pointer is pointing to.

Segmentation faults can occur in other cases too, such as attempting to access a value
that exceeds your arrays index or accessing invalid memory addresses.

Buffer Overflow, yet another common error, happens when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can
hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
<span class="alt-text">
  char buffer[10];
  char long_string[] = "This string is too long";
  strcpy(buffer, long_string);</span> <em>// Buffer overflow occurs here</em><span class="alt-text">
  printf("%s\n", buffer);</span> <em>// Undefined behavior</em>

This overflows the buffer because `buffer[10]` can only hold a maximum of 10 characters (which includes the null
terminator character (\0) that marks the end of a string) and the string "This string is too long" is significantly
longer than 10 characters; Therefore, when `strcpy` tries to copy this string into the buffer, it will write beyond
the allocated space, overwriting memory that belongs to other variables or data structures.

You should ensure that the destination buffer is always large enough to hold the source string.
"Use After Free" errors are another kind of error you may encounter. This occurs when a program tries to use
memory <em>after</em> it has already been freed, leading to undefined behavior. There are plenty of issues that are
bound to happen to you at some point, but from experience you can learn to avoid them.

Memory Leaks are another common error. They can happen when a program successfully allocates memory,
but fails to free it when it's no longer needed, leading to gradual memory depletion.
<span class="alt-text">
  int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));</span>

We often use an if statement, e.g. `if (ptr) {...` to check before. Attempting to free a NULL pointer is safe and
has no effect in C, nevertheless a NULL value in `ptr` would cause the `if (ptr)` check to not be executed.
This check would be prior to calling `free(ptr)` inside the body, to make sure that we do not inadvertently
free memory that hasn't been allocated, or free memory that has already been freed. So the effective use of
the if statement here promotes safer and more reliable code.

Later on, if we forgot to free this, or if we did not provide an if statement where its free'd because of a
certain condition, than much like the other errors that lead to malformations in memory, it would inevitably
cause issues, either very earlier on or at a later point in time. You can go without noticing an error/bug
for quite awhile. And, then its not until the program starts having issues w/ performance, or it crashes
that you then discover there was a bug. Therefore you want to catch those bugs sooner than later.
