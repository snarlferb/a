Macro's are another useful, though complicated idea that requires its own dedicated pretext
to adequately show and expand upon.

In certain cases, macros can help eliminate branching by replacing conditionally evaluated
expressions with branchless operations. For example, the following function introduces a
conditional branch (ternary operation):
<span class="alt-text">
  int min(int a, int b) {
    return (a &lt; b) ? a : b;</span>  // TODO: Replace this line.<span class="alt-text">
  }</span>

Thus we can replace this with a macro:
<span class="alt-text">
  #define MIN(a, b) ((a) &amp; -((a) &lt; (b)) | (b) &amp; -((b) &lt;= (a)))</span>

Macros are inherently harder to read, as they require explicit parentheses that
feel more like what the compiler would have to do to understand the skeleton code
and the sequences that each evaluation should to happen in order to fully parse things out.

The preprocessor (the first part of the process for macros) doesn't care about program
logic or control structures. It just handles textual substitution and directives in order
to pass said text off to the compiler, who then does all the logic and semantic handling.

We will break down what is happening in macros, how they are evaulated, etcetera.
Before we do that we have to briefly explain the order of operations; We sometimes
refer to as PEMDAS where "P" stands for <em>parentheses</em>, "E" is for exponent, etc.

C has specific ordering rules regarding operator precedence (which operators are evaluated first)
and associativity (the order in which operators of the same precedence level are evaluated).
I often find that the confusion arises in situations due to the way it looks w/ extra parentheses,
the added protection around a given token(s). Macros depend on having this terse separation,
so you will often see it exaggerated.

Next time you see something that fits this description try stripping away the parentheses;
then, look at it again and it should be a bit more clear to delineate, and in a way that
invovles following the normal hierarchy of precedence within the expression. Macros, being
that they are like their own compile-time language, are just another perspective on the code.

Lets talk about some utilities that macros have. Macro's can simplify an expression.
Heres an example related to r-values <em>(This is prior to simplification)</em>
<span class="alt-text">
  int max_val = type_max(typeof(var));
  int min_val = type_min(typeof(var));</span>

Then when we change it to become a macro, and assign it after.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define TYPE_MAX(val) type_max(val)
  #define TYPE_MIN(val) type_min(val)
  
  int max_val = TYPE_MAX(var);
  int min_val = TYPE_MIN(var);</span>

which you can see is simpler now to call.

This behavior applies to all other forms of C and its decree...
Heres a macro to access some element of a tuple-like structure (array)
<span class="alt-text">
  #define MACRO(x) ((x)[2])
    int tuple[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};</span>

MACRO(x) defines a macro named MACRO that takes a parameter x.
inside the macro, (x)[2]  accesses the third element of the array x.

tuple[] is an integer array with four elements, ` {10, 20, 30, 40} `
now, if you use the macro MACRO with the array tuple: ` int third_element = MACRO(tuple);`
expands to the following:
<span class="alt-text">
  int third_element = ((tuple)[2]);</span>

which effectively accesses the third element of the array tuple. In this case,
tuple[2] refers to 30 (because arrays are zero-indexed)

    tuple[0] is 10
    tuple[1] is 20
    tuple[2] is 30
    tuple[3] is 40

So, MACRO(tuple) will evaluate to tuple[2], giving you 30.
and the same is the case if `x` were a string, then MACRO(x) would access the third character of the string.
and that gives you a re-elucidates what you've learned so far about arrays and such.

The macro `#define C(x) ((x)-'@') ` , i.e. (x-64)  is another example that can be used in various contexts
to denote &lt;Key&gt;Ctrl, characters (e.g. 65 - 64 = 1, and Ctrl-A is the ASCII control character SOH
(Start of Heading) with an ASCII code of "1") making it easy to recognize and handle "Ctrl-X" mappings,
<span class="alt-text">
  if (key == C('S')) {
    save_file();
  }</span>

Let's look at something that I personally like using macros for. And that is, creating a macro out of
a header path, a path of the same name or place where its defined, wherein the named macro can be used
w/ `#include`... e.g.,
<span class="alt-text">
  #define HI_H "/path/to/macro.h"</span>

and then you can use it like `#include HI_H`, where by the preprocessor replaces it with the
actual header file path during the preprocessing stage.  Next here's an example of ifdef..

<span class="alt-text">
  #ifdef PLATFORM
  #include &lt;platform.h&gt;
  #define MESSAGE "Hello from whatever platform!"

  #else
  #include &lt;planetform.h&gt;</span><em> // Assume some other platform</em><span class="alt-text">
  #define MESSAGE "Hello from non-native planetform!"

  #endif

  int main() {
    printf("%s\n", MESSAGE);
    return 0;
  }</span>

`ifdef` checks if a macro named "PLATFORM" is defined. if so, the line `#include <platform.h>`
gets included because the condition is true. <em>And presumably, you can deduce the rest from there.</em>

be careful not to get `ifdef` mixed up with `ifndef`, which checks if a given macro is NOT defined.
its exactly the same as `#if !defined`, but a less obvious; They're both used interchangeably

Here we have a macro that shifts `2`, to the left by (n)bits, and then subtracts `1`.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define b(n) (2 &lt;&lt; (n))
  #define a(n) ((b(n))-1)</span>

if you call b(3), it would be equivalent to 2 &lt;&lt; 3, resulting in 16
if you call a(3), it would be equivalent to (2 &lt;&lt; 3) - 1
resulting in 15, which is a binary number with three bits set to 1 (111 in binary)
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("b is %d\n", b(3));
  printf("a is %d\n", a(3));</span>

    8 in binary = 1000
    4 in binary = 0100
    2 in binary = 0010
    1 in binary = 0001

3 in binary is a combination of 1 and 2, yadayada... Instead if we start with 2
and shift it over three places to the left, we have 100000, and 1 is in the 16th spot
making it 16

give these examples time to marinate, the Taj Mahal wasnt built in 45 seconds.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define MY_MACRO(ptr)  ((*ptr) * 2)</span>

and you use it as follows:
<span class="alt-text">
  int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int *ptr = array;
  int result = MY_MACRO(ptr);</span>

During preprocessing, `MY_MACRO(ptr)` will be replaced with `((*ptr) * 2)`
the `(*ptr)` is just a textual replacement that occurs before actual compilation.

These are variations of the backslash (\) character, in which it cancels-out the proceeding
character (we talk about the behavior of backslash characters in other sections) but in any
other case an escape sequence is determined by the proceeding character e.g. "\n" newline
<span class="alt-text">
  char s1[] = "Ca\\ncel";</span> <em>// ASCII</em><span class="alt-text">
  char s2[] = "Ca\134ncel";</span> <em>// octal</em><span class="alt-text">
  char s3[] = "Ca\x5Cncel";</span> <em>// hex</em>

Technically speaking, the backslash is an ID token that goes until it hits whitespace
in which case it might have the effect of continuating a line (or removing the line break
whichever way u prefer to see it) which may fall into the running logic of the rest of the code

This'll make sense as your brain unlocks the harder-to-grok details.
when you compile and run the following program, it will output: "sequence"...
<span class="alt-text">
  #define QUOTE(seq) "\""#seq"\""

  int main() {
    printf("%s\n", QUOTE(sequence));
  return 0;
  }</span>

... by preserving the " " air-quotes around sequence.

Note, the preprocessor has specific ways in which it expands a variable such in
our example `#seq` which acts as the stringification operator, converting the
macro argument seq into a string literal.

If you read everything on the page about functions, you would have learned that you can use
them to make a `type` of some variable... You can do the same with macro's here:
<span class="alt-text">
  #define DEFINE_SERVICE(name)              \
    typedef struct Service_##name##Rec {     \
        /* Define the structure fields here */\
    } Service_##name##Rec;                   \
    typedef Service_##name##Rec* Service_##name; \</span>

`name` is a placeholder in the macro, which gets replaced with the actual service name when
the macro is invoked. The first part of the macro, `Service_ ## name ## Rec;` , defines a
structure named w/ `Service_&lt;name&gt;Rec`. The placeholder name is replaced with the argument
provided as the macro is used (e.g., AppendThis).

The second part of the macro, `typedef Service_ ## name ## Rec* Service_ ## name;`, defines
a pointer type for the structure. It uses the same structure name (`Service_&lt;name&gt;Rec`) and
creates a pointer type `Service_&lt;name&gt;`, which points to a structure of that type.

These all come together via the `##` operator that does concatenation, wherein they've been
defined, you can declare variables of those types like...
<span class="alt-text">
  DEFINE_SERVICE(AppendThis)
  Service_AppendThis Hello;</span>

Heres another macro you can try...
<span class="alt-text">
  #define GIVE(return_type) return_type
  #define A_Func(this) \
      Generic(umbrella) \
      That_A_Func(this)</span>

Now when you declare it as a function declaration, it'll look like...
<span class="alt-text">
  Generic(umbrella) That_A_Func(AnotherType *this);</span>

The purpose of the first line is to enable flexible declaration of function return types using macros,
and without it the macro Generic(umbrella) would not be expanded correctly in the definition of `A_Func`.
since the #define follows the first one, the definition of `GIVE` is still active, and it will be
available for use within the definition of `A_Func`. So you can kinda see how the preprocessor works.

`do-while(0)` within a macro is a common C programming idiom. It allows the macro to be used as a
single statement in all contexts, particularly in if-else statements, without causing issues, e.g.,
<span class="alt-text">
  #define GOOD_MACRO(x) \
    do \
      { \
        if (x) \
          foo(); \
        bar(); \
      } \
    while (0)</span>

  <em>// Call the macro somewhere</em><span class="alt-text">
  GOOD_MACRO(y);</span>

The backslashes are purely cosmetic for readability and you can alternatively have it defined like...
<span class="alt-text">
  #define GOOD_MACRO(x) do { if(x) foo(); bar(); } while(0)</span>

The next example demonstrates an offset (youll remember we explained how
structs use offsets to access members) note: on my machine `size_t`  is a 64 bit unsigned int
<span class="alt-text">
  #define offsetof(s,m) ((size_t) &amp; (((s*)0)-&gt;m))

  struct s {
    char *a;
    int b;
    size_t c;
  };

  int main() {
    printf("a -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, a));
    printf("b -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, b));
    printf("c -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, c));
    return 0;
  }</span>

`(*s)` dereferences the pointer to the structure.
`(*s)-&gt;m` accesses the member `m` within the structure.
`&amp;((*s)-&gt;m)` gets the address of the member within the structure.
`(size_t) &amp;((*s)-&gt;m)` casts this address to `size_t`
and then, from __main__ our macro, *offset(struct..* takes 2 arguments `struct s, x`

if for some reason you just cant stomach the macro, here's an alternative method
to offsetof,  to set a field's value indirectly.
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example {
    int a;
    double b;
    int c;
  };

  int main() {
    struct example ex = {0, 0.0, 0};

    </span><em>// First calculate offset</em><span class="alt-text">
    size_t offset_c = offsetof(struct example, c);

    int new_value = 42;
    *(int *)((char *)&amp;ex + offset_c) = new_value;

    return 0;
  }</span>

In practice, you can simplify your expression by adjusting the cast scope. For instance,
take the example of a preprocessor condition, whereby we're doing something that may not
be valid C—as explicit casting is not meaningful w/ preprocessor directive like `#if`
that do not support runtime constructs—though they are in the case of normal macros..
That doesnt mean that your allowed to have a directive w/ a macro called in the
condition, that itself handles the casting. It will cause a compilation error.

Therefore it probably will not work to try this in `#if`, but it helps for demonstrating w/.
Lets say we've casted `int_example` type to the <em>first</em> level, tangent to each variable...
If we move the cast to one of the outermost levels, we'll have, in turn, casted to each variable
encapsulated within the same level of the shared parentheses... does that make sense?...
<span class="alt-text">
  #if !((int_example((E + 1) / A) &lt;&lt; (F - 2)) &amp; (int_example)G)</span>

In conclusion, we're trying to use our type `int_example` to cast within a preprocessor
condition (but as we said the preprocessor will not understand or perform type casting)

Here ive chosen to cast at the second parentheses level, which means ive excluded `G`
from the `int_example` association, and so ive added the cast tangent to it.
You could very well just add the cast to a parentheses that encapsulates ALL,
and have it applied to all of them, and thats usually what is the easiest to do.

Preprocessor directives like #if, #ifdef, and #ifndef are used in conditional compilation
to include or exclude parts of code based on certain conditions. We can of course make
our example into a macro instead, for a relative notion of what the difference is now.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define TRYEXAMPLE(E, A, F, G) \
    (((((E + 1) / (A)) &lt;&lt; ((F) - 2)) &amp; ((int)(G))))</span>

  Congratulations...
You've reached the end.
