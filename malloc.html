<b>Malloc</b>

First of all, what is dynamic memory allocation needed for?

When you need to manage a pool of data or when the exact size of data structures (like arrays
or linked lists) is not known until runtime, dynamic memory allocation is utilized.

It's especially useful for handling user input for example. Another example might be for large
data sets of some sort. The programmer is responsible for managing and freeing this memory
(e.g., using free() in C), or else it could lead to memory leaks.

In simple terminology, malloc is just a void pointer,  void *malloc(size_t size);  and so
it returns a pointer to the allocated memory block...

But here is how i like to think of it. You have things like the Task Manager or "Setting-&gt;App"
on your device, right?... Think of how those metrics are used to track the CPU% used by a process
(program) to show a total memory for a given application. Therefore, we can say that there's three
parts or metrics the computer uses: (1) Processor or CPU% usage, (2) RAM-based memory consumed,
(3) local-memory storage.

Thats why you can look at the total size of an app and it'll say like (5Kb), when clearly its
doing a whole lot more on that device/machine.  Well, thats because its taking advantage of
system resources, and these resources require extra amounts of stored memory that doesnt exist
within the realm of that 5Kb's or whatever. So, it stores the 5Kb, but then its dynamically
changing size and interacting with the system (hence dynamic memory allocation) 

Therefore we can say that the program doesn't know the exact size it needs beforehand, and so
malloc provides a way to request memory from the heap based on the program's needs after it has
been executed, and while it is running. Remember, that this is heap memory we're talking about,
a more flexible memory pool that can grow and shrink dynamically during runtime. The stack is
a **fixed-size memory** region used for function calls, local variables, and arguments (determined at compile time)

So instead of directly pushing memory onto the stack, memory may reside on the heap. We store
said memory only by location, as a *pointer address*, which does not contain information regarding
the length or size of that data being pointed to. It is then incumbent upon the user to manage and
track the memory subregions within the heap, which distinguishes between:
  A) Those that are occupied, versus...
  B) Those that are still available.

In conclusion, dynamic memory is allocated at runtime—Where the size of this memory can
change during execution aka runtime. And this implies that the program requests memory on an
as-needed basis; Functions like malloc(), calloc(), and realloc() can be used, malloc and free
being the go-to functions. `malloc`, in particular, takes the size of the memory block you want
to allocate in bytes as input (size_t size)

It returns  void*, a generic pointer type. You typically need to cast it to a specific
pointer type (e.g., int*) to access the allocated memory (a region of memory where a valid
return address or link may be associated with a given stack frame, after the function call)
The return address acts purely to indicate where the function execution should resume after
the function completes...

This is like a temporary detour, wherein you've called a function; but before the detour,
you have marked where you last left off—namely, at the return address. The CPU runs the
function, and, once the function finishes, the CPU jumps back to where it was before,
using the return address to continue from where it left off during the calling function.

Unlike memory thats on the stack, the heap can become fragmented as different-sized blocks of
memory are allocated and freed. That is to say, the system doesn't necessarily return memory
in the same order it was allocated, and it may reuse freed memory in any order that suits the
memory allocator based on which blocks are available, and the size of the allocation request.

The function `malloc_info` can be used to export the state of malloc to a stream in XML format,
providing the current state of the heap memory like the size of allocated and free blocks.
When using GNU Libc (glibc), the heap is managed by internal structures like malloc_state,
malloc_chunk. Lets turn our attention to the std library, to see what malloc takes:
<span class="alt-text">
  void *malloc(size_t size);</span>

as you see, it returns a pointer to the allocated memory block...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct Point {
    int x; int y;
  };

  struct Point *myPoint = malloc(sizeof(struct Point));</span>

You then might use offsetof (or `offsetof()`) that helps in determining the correct
size to allocate when using memory allocation (*malloc, calloc, etc..*) for a structure.
It has two parameters (type, member) and returns the offset of a given member within
the given type, in units of bytes:
<span class="alt-text">
  size_t structSize = sizeof(struct Point);
  offsetof(struct Point, y);</span>

You'll be able to use  myPoint  and  yOffset  to access the "y" member.
Note: When you free memory, the pointer to that memory thereafter is invalid, and the memory is
returned to the system’s pool of available memory. <em>The content of the freed memory is not changed/cleared.</em>

When you allocate memory using malloc(), the memory is usually managed by sbrk() on said heap. And,
if an allocation request exceeds M_MMAP_THRESHOLD, malloc() will instead use mmap() to allocate memory
directly from the system. You can learn more about this by looking up the M_MMAP_THRESHOLD parameter,
and the environment command `export MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_= ...`. These types of variables are part of
glibc's "user-configurable settings", where by convention they have an extra underscore at the end.

In general, when using malloc(), there are two primary approaches to memory management: <b>immediate use
and free</b> versus <b>delayed free for reuse</b>. The first approach involves allocating memory, using it
temporarily within a limited scope (such as within a single loop iteration or function call), and then
immediately freeing it before the next allocation. The second approach involves allocating memory and
keeping it for later use, either by storing the allocated pointers in an array or by allocating a
contiguous block of memory for reuse. This approach is necessary when data needs to persist across
multiple operations, such as when handling dynamically allocated arrays, maintaining state across
iterations, or working with structures that require dynamic memory.

It really just depends on the sequence of data, and how long you need the allocated data for...
Regardless of the approach, it's important to handle allocation failures using `if (!ptr) { ... }`
to ensure robustness and to avoid dereferencing NULL. You can look back at <a class="reserve" href="err.html">this page</a> to avoid common memory errors.
