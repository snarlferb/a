<h3>___ Attributes Continued ___</h3>
When defining a class-like structure in C and associating it with a static instance,
any initialization logic encapsulated in a 'constructor' function must be invoked
early in the program's lifecycle, typically at the start of execution. This guarantees
that the static instance is in a well-defined state before any operations are performed on it.

When you don't specify a priority, the execution order of constructors and destructors follows
the natural order dictated by the compiler or runtime environment. In GNU extensions
`(__attribute__((constructor))`  and  `__attribute__((destructor)))`  constructors,
without explicit priority,  run in an unspecified, but consistent, order, typically
based on the linking or declaration order.

There's no need to assign priorities explicitly if your program doesn't have strict
dependencies between objects or resources, and initialization/cleanup order doesn't matter.

And so, for specifying priorities, you can fine-tune the order in which constructors and
destructors are executed. Default priority exists within the range 0—100... And if we say
<span class="alt-text">
  void prioritized_constructor() __attribute__((constructor(101)));
  void prioritized_destructor() __attribute__((destructor(101)));</span>

Then, prioritized_constructor() and prioritized_destructor() will be executed after
constructors/destructors with said default priority, if that makes sense.

The following code defines a test function that demonstrates the use of constructors and
destructors to initialize and terminate a sequence. This is achieved through ELF '.section'
manipulation, leveraging the 'section' attribute to explicitly place functions in the '.ctors' and '.dtors' sections.

<span class="alt-text">
  #define SECTION(S) __attribute__ ((section ( S )))

  void test(void) {
    printf("\n\ttest() utilizing -- (.section .ctors/.dtors) w/o priority\n");
  }</span>

  <em>/* custom section placement */</em><span class="alt-text">

  void (*funcptr1)(void) SECTION(".ctors") =test;
  void (*funcptr2)(void) SECTION(".ctors") =test;
  void (*funcptr3)(void) SECTION(".dtors") =test;</span>

  <em>/* create the prioritized entries in the .ctors, .dtors ELF sections */</em><span class="alt-text">

  void construct_num1 () __attribute__ ((constructor (101)));
  void construct_num2 () __attribute__ ((constructor (102)));
  void destruct_num1 () __attribute__ ((destructor (101)));
  void destruct_num2 () __attribute__ ((destructor (102)));</span>

  <em>/* init_some_function() - called by elf_init() */</em><span class="alt-text">

  int init_some_function() {
    printf("\n  init_some_function() called by elf_init()\n");
    return 1;
  }</span>

  <em>/* elf_init uses inline assembly to place itself in the ELF .init section,
         i.e. what/where it is being called within during startup sequence */</em><span class="alt-text">

  int elf_init(void) {
    __asm__ (".section .init \n call elf_init \n .section .text \n");</span>

    <em>/* if initialization fails, the program will exit early with an error */</em><span class="alt-text">

    if(!init_some_function ())
    {
      exit(1);
    }

    printf("\n  elf_init() -- (.section .init)\n");

    return 1;
  }</span>

  <em>/* function definitions for construct_numX and destruct_numX */</em><span class="alt-text">

  void construct_num1() {
    printf("\n  construct_num1() constructor -- (.section .ctors) priority 101\n");
  }
  
  void construct_num2() {
    printf("\n  construct_num2() constructor -- (.section .ctors) priority 102\n");
  }
  
  void destruct_num1() {
    printf("\n  destruct_num1() destructor -- (.section .dtors) priority 101\n");
  }
  
  void destruct_num2() {
    printf("\n  destruct_num2() destructor -- (.section .dtors) priority 102\n");
  }

  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("\n\t this is main \n");
    return 0;
  }</span>

You would then go on to run this program, and analyze the order that said output
falls within—should it reflect what we had intended it to be in the code.

you may go back to the <a class="reserve" href="page10.html">previous page</a>, should you have missed any
of the meanings or definitions of these keywords and attributes.

<h3>___ Calling Conventions ___</h3>
There's one last thing I want to talk, and that's called "calling conventions", as it is sortve a bridge into the next...

For modern Linux systems (on x86-64 architecture) the calling convention used is the System V AMD64 ABI,
which has largely replaced (cdecl) for default function calling. Instead, the first six integer or pointer
arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9 in that order.

__attribute__((cdecl)) isnt used as much on Linux for new code because the default convention (System V AMD64 ABI)
is generally more efficient with its register usage. cdecl is more relevant in 32-bit environments where stack-based
argument passing is more common due to fewer registers. You might still see or need __attribute__((cdecl)) when
interfacing with older libraries or code that uses cdecl.
