<div id="ctrl-anch"><b>Control Flow</b></div>
<!-- See full comment @ #jump-here -->
Conditional code is an essential aspect of programming, enabling you to control the
flow of execution based on specific criteria. Understanding how to effectively use
contructs like if statements, for loops, while loops, is crucial in developing
algorithms that respond dynamically to varying inputs and states.

It's best to get use to writing conditonal code because alot of what you will be
thinking and doing is similar—that is to say you have to think about the range and
behavior of something, and then set those conditions that either allow or prevent
the execution of subsequent actions or statements.

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is
true/false or <em>equal to</em>.

When you have a single statement, the very first function call is associated with
that `if`,  but the second one is not, e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  if (my_condition)
    do_something();
    do_something_else();</span> <em>// not part of it</em>

It makes more sense when you write it in one line  `if (my_condition) do_something();`,
and helps you understand what you are doing before creating a multi-branch, compound
statement. A single statement ends once the program reaches the first semicolon.

We'll be explaining the pieces to this next example later, but assume we have a function,
`int get_resource(void){...}`
<span class="alt-text">
  void use_resource(void) {
    int resource = get_resource();
    if (!resource) return;
  }</span>

`!resource` checks if resource is "0" (false). If resource is in fact 0, the function
returns, i.e. it exits immediately—no further code runs. If its "1" (true), then the
`return`  inside the if block is skipped, and all remaining code in `use_resource(void)`
function, after that line, is skipped (return w/no value defaults to `return 0`)

So although a function continues executing the code that follows the if block, it depends.
And in our example, `return` actually changes the flow of execution <em>(we'll speak more on return)</em>

An `else` and/or `else if` following an `if` can also be used as single statements
associated w/ a single block, or as multi-branch statements.

`else` &amp; `elseif` provide an alternative branch or block of code to be executed,
given the condition is true/false or "equal to". In that sense, switch statements are then
used for multi-way branching sequences to be evaluated based on the value of some expression.

Specifically, `else if` allows you to specify another <em>condition</em> to test the previous
`if` or `else if` conditions.

Its at that point that the associated `else` statement would be evaluated instead,
if an `else` statement is present. Conditions may depend on a given expression, as
well as whatever the operator is evaluated to. When talking about `else if` versus
having `else` w/ a nested if block, there's a subtle difference between the two...

The `else if` method collapses the conditions, so checks may be applied broadly,
potentially causing logic errors if conditions aren't mutually exclusive.
Nested `if` in `else` keeps conditions clearly separated, so that checks
are only applied to relevant subsets. You should experiment with the two
in order to grasp where the discrepancy in behavior lies!...

When you have a function within the condition of an `if` statement, it leads to the function
being executed at that point in the program flow, presuming the following provisions are met:
A) The function's return value must evaluate to true according to C's truthiness rules. That
is, any non-zero return value is considered true, and zero is treated as false, and...

B) The function name in the condition must refer to an actual function w/ braces, e.g.
`if (my_condition())`. Function names in C are treated as pointers to the function, so in an if
condition like  `if (my_condition)`, you're actually checking if the address of the function
is non-zero (i.e., that the function exists). However, this does not call the function.

To call the function and check its return value, you must include the parentheses just like we demonstrated.

This rule applies not only to if statements but also to other control flow statements, such as loops
(while, for, etc.), where the function in the condition will be called each time the condition is evaluated.

<b>Loops</b>

Loops in C are constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until the
respective conditions are no longer true (repeated execution so as long as a condition holds true).
This eliminates the need to write the same code multiple times. I'll try to portray the intricacies involed.

<em>Note: You can also write code iteratively without using traditional loops. Iterative
solutions can often be achieved through recursion or by using functions that internally
handle iteration. In cases where you want to understand the individual components of a loop
it then might be necessary, however you could just as easily write it out as pseudocode.</em>

In a for loop, the first part of the loop (before the first semicolon) is specifically
for initializing variables BEFORE the loop starts. These initializations are executed
only once, right before the loop begins its first iteration. `for (i = j = ...`, would
be an example of having TWO variables initialized before the loop begins, where as in
this example  `for (i = j; j = ..`,  "j" is being set after the loop begins, albeit at
the start of each loop iteration.

I am of course demonstrating this in the ANSI C89 style of creating for loops, where you
have presumably initialized them earlier in the function. Most of the time, with some
simple adjustments you can interpret one interchangeably with the other style; Its just
a matter of making sure that when you move the declaration of e.g. "int i" into the
condition of the for loop, that nothing else depends on "int i", otherwise you should
keep the "int i" declaration, and then change the for loop to the style you prefer.

Before every iteration, the loop condition (e.g., `i &lt; 5` in a for loop) is checked.
If the condition is true, the loop body is executed; if it's false, the loop terminates.
As the loop iterates, each statement in the loop body is executed sequentially.

You might see the `continue` keyword used in the loop body. When the program encounters
`continue`, it skips the remaining lines of code in the current iteration (of the body)
and then immediately proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. The loop condition is
still checked before the next iteration begins. Here's how it can be used meaningfully
w/ an if statement inside of a for loop,
<span class="alt-text">
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue;</span> <em>// Skip the rest of the loop body when i is 2
        // .. where upon this will be skipped</em><span class="alt-text">
    }</span>
    <em>// .. This is also skipped when i = 2</em><span class="alt-text">
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
  }</span>

If (some condition), then continue past the rest of the iteration. In our example, the output
will only leave out "i = 2" since that is what we skipped.

The `break` keyword is used to exit a statement/loop prematurely. When it see's  `break` the
loop immediately terminates, and control is passed to whatever comes after it. So if `break`
is responsible for breaking at the point that its encountered, `return` (which is optional)
exits the transfer's control from a given block of code or function  to another, or optionally
returns a value to the caller. For example  `if (j == 2) {  break; ... `, will exit the inner
loop when j is 2. In a switch statement, if it matches, e.g.  `case 1: ... break;`, it will
exit the switch statement once it see's the `break`, bypassing remaining case labels and
the default case.

In the context of control statements (w/ return type, "void"), without having specified the
value associated w/ the return statement, return will function to exit, as long as said
condition is met. If the condition is "false", the function will continue executing the rest
of the code. A void function is explicitly defined to not return any value, so attempting to
return a value (e.g., return 0;) would violate the rules, which results an error.
see <a class="reserve" href="func.html">func.html</a> to learn more about return statements.

The start and end of the statement also marks the memory allocation boundary, or
rather a new sequence of memory. You might then call the start or redirection of a
proceeding sequence "control flow transfer" or "control flow manipulation" -which refers
to the mechanism by which the program's execution flow is redirected based on the condition
or loop. Its something you have to be conscious of in situations where specific sequences of
memory matter (or more importantly) situations where the exact format-layout of the code matters.
the same is the case where you have ordered vs non-ordered arrays. In C, these are ordered by default. 

A `do...while` loop is similar to a while loop, with one key difference:
the `do...while` loop guarantees that the code inside the loop will be executed at least once,
regardless of whether the condition is true initially. This is because the condition is evaluated
after the code block has been executed.

A goto statement provides a way to transfer control to a labeled statement within a function.
Once the program has encountered it, it jumps to the specified label. Execution continues sequentially
from that point unless explicitly redirected or interrupted by control flow statements (including `goto`
jumping the program elsewhere...)—execution under a label continues to occur even if another label falls
within the sequence of that execution, and as such continues to execute until it encounters a return
statement, or reaching the end of the function.

The structured use of goto and labels helps avoid collisions or conflicts in control flow because
each labeled section serves a specific purpose within the function. There are no ambiguities about
which code path or branch to follow after jumping to a label. It creates an explicit divide,
so you'll often see functions that design themselves in such a way where they can recall
the same code multiple times, which may have otherwise been problematic without.

Lets dig a little deeper. Control flow statements primarily work by altering the program
counter (the CPU register that keeps track of the next instruction as explained)
they don't directly navigate memory in the sense of manipulating memory addresses.
For example, when an `if` statement is encountered, the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true, the program counter is updated to point to the first
instruction within the `if` block.

These instructions are then fetched and executed from memory. If the condition is false
and an `else` block exists, the program counter is updated to point to the first instruction
within the `else` block; Otherwise, the program continues execution from the next
instruction after the `if` statement.

`setjmp`, as well as longjmp can be used to control the flow of execution. They are different from
the normal control flow mechanisms like if, else, for, while, and do-while, which operate within
the boundaries of a function. longjmp and setjmp can jump across function boundaries (non-locally)
as well as back to previous code, e.g. `setjmp(jmp_buf)` might be used to save the current state
of the program into a `jmp_buf` buffer, where `longjmp(jmp_buf, 1)` jumps back to the saved state,
effectively causing the program to execute the code at the point where setjmp was called.

Understanding control flow is crucial not just for writing functional code but also for secure
and error-free applications. `if` statements can help mitigate some of the more deviant errors
that may arise during program execution. By properly managing conditions and branches, you can
reduce the risk of errors like overflow errors (like a max integer bound that could potentially
wrap around) buffer or integer overflows, memory leaks, and null pointer dereferences are just
a few of the errors that you should be mindful of, for example;
<span class="alt-text">
  int main() {
    unsigned int var = UINT_MAX;
    unsigned int value = 0;

    if (var == UINT_MAX) {
      printf("Overflow would occur!\n");
      var = value;
    } else {
      value++;</span>
      <em>/* This is a silly example for demonstration:
       * The post-increment means the value remains the same
       * until after the current statement (more about unary
       * operators later)
       * Checking the value of 'var' in the condition and
       * then incrementing it within the loop body can lead
       * to redundancy, as both instances of 'var' will iterate.
       * (unlikely to be the intended behavior)
       * however its just for illustration purposes so you
       * understand that the scope of unary operators locally
       * apply to variables of the same name.
       */</em><span class="alt-text">
      printf("Incremented var: %u\n", var);
    }
    return 0;
  }</span>

An overflow occurs here because `var` is of type unsigned int, which has a maximum value
defined (65535) (on 32 bit and 64 bit this is not the case, but lets just say it is for
demonstration purposes) When we attempt to increment it beyond this value, it wraps around
to 0, causing an overflow condition. Also, its quite common to use an if statement to check a
condition and perform an action at once. For more information on errors <a class="reserve" href="err.html">see this</a>

This is typical for values that either wrap around to zero, or become negative, when they're
in fact too large to be represented in the <em>current</em> data type. For context, say you
add "1" to UINT_MAX, the result will be UINT_MIN (the minimum value an int can hold). So,
if we were to check whether or not an overflow would occur, it would be more accurate to
say,  "if (code_is LESS_THAN max...)"

From the Arithmetic Logic Unit's perspective, it wouldnt inherently know the difference between
an overflow and a negative value when it comes to signed integer types, so it distinguishes
them using an overflow flag for overflow and the "sign bit/flag" (most significant bit) for
a negative value, to correctly signal when the result of an arithmetic operation goes beyond
the range. For zero values, a zero flag is used, for both signed and unsigned integers.

Obviously unsigned integers dont have negative values, so it only uses two flags, the carry
flag for overflow and the zero flag. Extra information (carry, zero, sign and overflow) about
the data we've received makes use of a 1-bit register.

When you compare data, its really just performing subtraction between the two; A negative value
is "less than", a zero value means that its "equal to", and a positive value is "greater than".


<div id="fmt-anch"><b>Format Specifiers</b></div>
The function `printf()` is interesting (and we'll talk more about it later), but it allows you to
specify the number of characters that a given object is aligned to, and what kind of data you want
to have in the output. So say you were printing an arbitrary integer, `printf("%3d", 5)`; It will
output "5", but itll also have three characters (two spaces) included w/ it.

You can also shift that number so it is on the left, by using `-` next to it, like `%-3d` (without
the hyphen, it should be automatically right aligned). You can also use an asterisk to reference a
variable, say `int x = 14` was declared; Now that can referenced in place of the character/align,
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("%*s", x, "hivehollow");
</span>
And this logic carries over into floating point, such that you are always specifying the
`"%width.precisionf"` that you want in the output:
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("%width.precisionf", value);
</span>
Below is a list of format specifiers that determine what type of data should be printed
or scanned in input and output operations.

At this point, you, the user have not learned about functions.
So skip over that which is unfamiliar, and come back to it (in the future it will be more straightforward)

The modulus operator ensures that values stay within a fixed range. So instead of using loops or conditional checks
to manually wrap around when reaching the end of the alphabet for example, modulus handles it automatically. If we
consider that the alphabet starts at 0, and ends at 26, then  `(x+13)mod(26)` each character (you have to extend
the algorithm if you want a non-zero base). We do this check for both upper/lowercase:
<span class="alt-text">
  char intern_case_audition(char c) {
    return (c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z') ? ((c - 'A' + 13) % 26) + 'A' :</span>  <em>// continues on next line...</em><span class="alt-text">
           (c &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'z') ? ((c - 'a' + 13) % 26) + 'a' : c;
  }

  void rot13_str_recursive(char *str) {
    if (*str) {
        *str = intern_case_audition(*str);
        rot13_str_recursive(str + 1);
    }
  }</span>

The if (*str) statement acts as a stop condition by checking/and preventing the function from making further
recursive calls once it reaches the null terminator ('\0') at the end of the string. We could have used a loop
in place of doing the recursive step, however I liked how it followed from the if statement theme we had earlier.

Going back to the ternary operator in the first function; Ternary is a shorthand for if-else, and it has the following ingredients:

  condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;

If `condition` is true, the result is "expression_if_true"; otherwise, if `condition` is false, the result is "expression_if_false".

Next: When you use the unary increment (++) or decrement (- -) operators on a variable  <!--\-->
they directly modify the variable's value within its lifetime.                      <!--\-->

This means that the change to the variable's value persists regardless of whether the  <!--\-->
variable is being assigned to another variable or used as an r-value (the right-hand side of an assignment or in an expression)
<span class="alt-text">                                        ==    !=    &gt;     &lt;    &gt;=     &lt;=</span>    <!--relational    \-->
<span class="alt-text">                                           &amp;    |    ^    ~    &lt;&lt;     &gt;&gt;</span>    <!--bitwise         \-->
<span class="alt-text">   =   +=     -=     *=    /=     %=     &lt;&lt;=    &gt;&gt;=     &amp;=     ^=     |=</span>    <!--assignment        \-->

Here's an interesting demonstration of the unary pre-increment, consider `if (++example == newvalue)`.
In this case `++example` increments the value of `example` by 1 before performing the comparison,
whereby the incremented value of `example` is then compared with `newvalue`.
This sometimes depends on factors such as the size of the "type" that it points to.

During post-increment, the evaluation of the condition happens with the original value of the
variable, **before** the increment takes place. After the comparison, then `example` is incremented...
And because unary increment/decrement affect the variable in the lifetime of a given statement,
than it still remains effective. Post/pre increment or decrement cannot be an lvalue.

Your key takeaway should be that post or pre increment/decrement has TWO effects.. in the case of
assignment, it literally adds/subtracts (1) to itself in memory (remaining in affect for the scope
that its in) as well as performing the post or pre increment/decrement for the given assignment,
condition, function argument or an array index (note, there's one important distinction here,
e.g. `(*x)++`  increments the value stored at the memory location x points to, where as `*(x++)` de-
references x before incrementing the pointer itself (pointer moves, but the value at old x is unchanged)

Comparison operators can be used within expressions that are on the right-hand side (r-value),
producing a boolean "1" for true, or "0" for false, which is then assigned to the l-value.
<span class="alt-text">
  int result = (a &gt;= b);</span>

This example is signed, however the comparison of unsigned expressions w/ ‘&gt;= 0’ is always true,
seeing as they are by definition &gt;= 0, which would result in a warning (warnings are considered errors)


<div id="storage-class-anch"><b>Storage Class Specifiers</b></div>
The term static, as used in programming, specifies the storage duration or lifetime of a variable or function.
A static variable retains its value between function calls, meaning it preserves its state across the program's
execution, unlike local variables that are created and destroyed each time a function is entered and exited
(the terms entered and exited can be thought of as, “read or no longer read” if that helps you imagine it conceptually)

Linkage (or visibility) refers to the scope or reach of a variable or function. When a variable is declared
as a local variable, it typically has automatic linkage, meaning it’s only visible and accessible within the
function or block where it's declared. However, a global variable, on the other hand, has external linkage
by default, making it visible across multiple translation units (or source files) in the program.
This means the variable or function can be accessed anywhere in the code after its declaration,
as long as the necessary references are included (such as with extern).

The keyword extern is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another translation unit.
It signals that the variable or function has external linkage—i.e., it's visible and can be accessed across
different source files (translation units). Without extern, the variable or function would be treated as
having internal linkage, meaning it’s limited to the scope of the current file.

<div id="type-qualifier-anch">Type Qualifiers</div>
`const` is used to specify that a variable's value cannot be modified after initialization
consider it also a form of documentation and a contract with the caller that a function shouldnt
attempt to modify the provided variable.

The value of a const-qualified object however is not a constant expression in the full sense of the term,
and cannot be used for array dimensions, case labels, and the like. (C is unlike C++ in this regard.)
When you need a true compile-time constant, use a preprocessor #define (or enum)!

i always get confused by these terms like, const-qualified, logically quantified, etc...
look up the following terms if you want resolve any confusion that may be caused by like-terms, e.g.
modifiers (modify other identifiers), quantifiers (in mathematics they specify quantities of a set)
identifiers (the names of the entities in the programming language), delimeters (specify boundaries,
e.g. commas). also a semicolon at the end of a statement is an example of a statement terminator.
