<em>The following is a very rough, compact description of how i view the internals
of the cpu, starting with dram and then everything else from the cpu's perspective.
This is what i have come to understand <b>so far</b>  and should in no way be
taken as a total understanding. This is my attempt to summarize cpu components
in a broad sense as well as the underlying memory cell/logic gate structuring.
The complexity and elegance of the broader design shouldnt be taken for granted.
It should be noted however that we are focusing on the more elaborate and hard -to-
parse components, such as: registers, control unit, ALU, clock, mmu, and cache,
albeit in elementary terms. Therefore this is only a basic description of a
processor, even still, everything can be understood as a circuit of tiny wires,
capacitors and transistors that carry an electrical charge. Knowing what your
basic logic gates are is an important first step: NOT  OR  AND  NOR  NAND  XOR</em>

("<em>a summary on dram</em>"): Part 1 <a href="dram">How</a> <a href="dram">dram?</a>

Part 2 How computer = cpu.register&gt;&gt;dram?
[fetch][decode][execute]

Storage in dram is volatile (meaning it relies on power or electrical charge to
maintain said data's integrity) and dram is intimately connected w/ the cpu and its
ability to calculate as well as in determining which instruction to perform.
And this cpu.register&gt;&gt;dram relationship has an affinite connection with the
rest of the computer/hardware, or 'device drivers'; in terms of this loop;

 <em>cpu -> to a storage device -> and back to cpu.register>>dram</em>.

So coupled w/ the real-time clock, used to keep counting, in conjuction with the
low standby power CMOS Static RAM, ssd/hdd retain a small level of voltage/or charge
to keep memory persistent. In conclusion its regarded as safe, but generally not
recommended to unplug storage drives and keep it un-housed from its host netgate.

register (technical facts) = in cell terms, it is a group of flip-flop circuits
that store 1 or 0. There are many different kinds of registers, but this one is
for storing a binary word, and one flip-flop is needed for each bit in the word.
What are the internals of a flip-flop?!__!

A register in actuality is itself a storage element for addresses.
During the fetch phase, it is meant to retrieve an instruction from dram.
The Address register is wired into dram. dram interprets that as a value and then
sends back the associated address to the Instruction register. Next, opcode,
or the first 4 bits of the address corresponds to Load-A instruction.
The other bits of the address correspond to a dram address.
Here are some registers.... General-purpose register, stack pointer,
status flag register, vector registor, control register... accumulator           =  stores data for ALU
program counter       =  points to next instruction
instruction register  =  stores instruction
data register         =  stores data
address register      =  stores address
temporary register    =  stores temporary data
input/ouput registers =  stores input and output data

control unit () = which is responsible for decoding and executing instructions, determines
how to translate each high-level instruction into the appropriate micro-operations.
There's typically only one high-level instruction like `ADD` available to developers
in assembly language. However, under the hood, the CPU's microarchitecture breaks down
this single high-level instruction into multiple micro-operations to execute it efficiently.
The choice of micro-operations for a particular high-level instruction depends on:
First off, the microarchitecture of the CPU determines how that instruction is executed internally.
Different CPUs have different microarchitectures, which dictate how instructions are decoded,
executed, and retired. Each microarchitecture may have its own strategies for breaking down
instructions into micro-operations based on factors like pipeline depth, instruction scheduling,
and available execution units. It also checks for data dependencies to ensure that instructions
are executed in the correct order and waits (if necessary) until the required data is available.

The control unit also ensures that the necessary resources, such as registers, execution units,
and functional units, are available to execute the micro-operations. It coordinates the allocation
and scheduling of these resources to optimize execution efficiency. **Branch prediction** is crucial
as well, and itll determine the "flow" of execution... Therefore, the decoder may predict those outcomes
of "conditional branching" -therein fetching and decoding a subsequent instruction(s).

The control unit of a CPU includes an optimization technique known as pipelining, which allows multiple
instructions to be executed concurrently by dividing the execution process into sequential stages.
Each stage of the pipeline is responsible for a specific task, such as instruction fetching, decoding,
execution, and memory access. As one stage is fetching an instruction, another related instruction is
simultaneously being decoded. This handoff between stages allows for efficient overlap of instruction
execution, maximizing throughput and performance.

Control signals are generated based on the decoded instruction and specify the actions to be taken by
each stage of the pipeline. These control signals determine which functional units are activated,
which data paths are selected, and how the instruction progresses through the pipeline stages.
Control signals are encoded to facilitate efficient instruction execution and minimize delays in the pipeline.

Pipeline encoding includes mechanisms for detecting and handling pipeline hazards, such as data hazards,
control hazards, and structural hazards. Techniques such as forwarding, stalling, and branch prediction
are used to mitigate the impact of hazards on pipeline performance. Control signals are encoded to trigger
these hazard detection and resolution mechanisms as needed.

Data forwarding and bypassing mechanisms are used to transfer data directly from one pipeline stage to another
without waiting for it to be written to memory or registers.

In superscalar and out-of-order execution pipelines, instructions are scheduled for execution based on availability
of resources and dependencies between instructions. Instruction scheduling algorithms determine the order in which
instructions are issued to execution units, taking into account pipeline constraints and dependencies.

control unit <b>(technical facts)</b> = It recognizes Load-A instruction circuit by matching the opcodes 4 bit address.
The physical circuit layout IS the match. In other words, each transistor will output the opcode correctly or not.
Which leads to the execute phase. The output of that Load-A checking instruction turns on dram's read/enable line and sends
the remaining bits of the dram address. dram retrieves the value at that address. Because it stems from a Load-A instruction,
the value has to be stored in register A, (none of the other registers). When dram's data wires are wired to 4 data registers,
the Load-A match circuit turns on the write/enable of only register A. For the next instruction, everything is turned off.
The Address register is then incremented by 1 bit, and we do the entire process again.

Again the control unit is responsible for selecting the right registers to pass in as inputs and to configure the ALU to
perform the right operation. So for example, the Control Unit enables register B and feeds its value into the first input of
the ALU. It also enables register A and feeds that into the second input of the ALU <em>ALU (lookahead carry circuit !__!
composed of AND/OR gates)</em> The 'add' instruction determined by the opcode, is a 2 bit address. The add opcode is passed
into the ALU. The output will be saved to register A. For this, the Control Unit uses an internal register of its own to
temporarily save the output, turn off the ALU and then write the value into the proper register.
Then we begin again, incrementing the Address register by 1 bit. It goes through the usual fetch and decode.
The address is then passed to dram but this time its a 'STORE' instruction. So instead of read-enabling, it write-enables.
At the same time it read-enables register A. This opens the data line to pass in the value stored in from register A.

clock = () Triggers an electrical signal within specific intervals. It advances the operation of the cpu, corresponding with specific registers.
What are the internals of TODO!__!
[<em>Describe a pulse transition detector here</em>]

mmu = () is a memory unit responsible for mapping addresses to ram. It keeps track of shifts between virtual and physical addresses.

cache = () a storage element. It is sram, by which it does not have a refresh step. It finds application in the correspondence of main memory blocks
and those in the cache. This is specified by the specific mapping instruction.
Cache internally is also a group of flip-flop gates.
