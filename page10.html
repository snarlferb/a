<h3>___ Bit Manip ___</h3>
In the following we are going to look at bit fields and bitwise operations.
You cannot declare expressions that perform bit-level manipulations DIRECTLY,
as such you must define them in a struct for example, then use them.
Bit fields allow you to specify how many bits that variable should hold,
effectively adding more bit positions-or rather a field of bits,
of which can be either 0 or 1

The following declares bit field (1000) i.e. the 4th bit set, in a struct.
This implies you can group related flags together within a structure.
Afterward it is set yet again when we do (1 &lt;&lt; 3) which is equivalent to (1 * (2^(3))),
or you could say we shifted a 1 bit (0001) three positions to the left
Whereby we OR (1000) and (1000) together, which equals (1000), as thats what
OR does w/ equivalent bits <em>(as it does e.g., 1010 | 0101 = 1111 w/ indifferent bits)</em>

When you think of OR, think of <em>amalgamation  or always active when indifferent</em>  or
better yet refer to AXONN for memorizing every logic gate easily.
<span class="alt-text">
  struct {
    unsigned int is_hidden : 4;
  } FilePermit;

  int main() {
    FilePermit.is_hidden |= (1 &lt;&lt; 3);</span>

    <em>// Check if the 4th bit is set</em><span class="alt-text">
    int isFourthBitSet = (FilePermit.is_hidden &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; 3)) != 0;
    printf("4th bit set to: %d\n", isFourthBitSet);

    return 0;
  }</span>

Here's an arbitrary example that does the same thing w/ bitwise shift.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define KERMIT (1 &lt;&lt; 0) | (1 &lt;&lt; 1) | (1 &lt;&lt; 2) | (1 &lt;&lt; 3)</span>
  <em>// Individualized flags, for clarity</em><span class="alt-text">
  #define THEFROG (1 &lt;&lt; 0)
  #define THETOAD (1 &lt;&lt; 1)
  #define THEPIG (1 &lt;&lt; 2)
  #define THEGOOSE (1 &lt;&lt; 3)

  struct FilePermit {
    unsigned char is_hidden;
  };

  int main() {
    struct FilePermit permit = {0};
    permit.is_hidden |= THEGOOSE;
    int isFourthBitSet = (permit.is_hidden &amp; THEGOOSE) != 0;
    printf("4th bit set to: %d\n", isFourthBitSet);
    return 0;
  }</span>

Experiment with it.

<h3>___ Wat dem der attibutes uh fer? ___</h3>

e.g., __attribute__((__noreturn__))

The "attribute" keyword is considered the beginning of the attribute.. Where as e.g., "noreturn" specifies a characteristic of a given entity.

[[deprecated]]
[[__deprecated__]]
[[deprecated("reason")]] ... which indicates that the use of the name or entity declared with this attribute is allowed, but discouraged for i.e. <em>reason</em>
[[__deprecated__("reason")]]
[[fallthrough]] ... indicates that the fall through from the previous case label is intentional and should not be diagnosed by a compiler that warns on fall-through
[[__fallthrough__]]
[[nodiscard]]
[[__nodiscard__]]
[[nodiscard("reason")]] ... encourages the compiler to issue a warning if the return value is discarded
[[__nodiscard__("reason")]] 	
[[maybe_unused]] ... suppresses compiler warnings on unused entities, if any
[[__maybe_unused__]]
[[noreturn]]
[[__noreturn__]]
[[unsequenced]] ... indicates that a function is stateless, effectless, idempotent and independent
[[__unsequenced__]]
[[reproducible]] ... indicates that a function is effectless and idempotent
[[__reproducible__]]

every standard attribute whose name is of form   attr  can be also spelled as  __attr__  and its meaning is not changed.
this means that, for example,  __attribute__((attr))  can be simplified to __attr__  ... And likewise  __attribute__((packed))
can being written as  __packed__ ... or to better illustrate this, take the e.g.,
<span class="alt-text">
  void do_something(int x) __attribute__((noreturn));</span>

which is declaring a function that uses this attribute. It could instead be written as...
<span class="alt-text">
  void do_something(int x) __noreturn__;</span>

it is not always the case that you can simplify them, as you'll see in the GCC-specific examples.
note, that you can declare these functions before their definition (separating declaration from implementation)

but here's a few additional things or outliers i can allude to...
<span class="alt-text">
  __attribute__ ((aligned (16)) char stack0[4096 * NCPU];</span>

this array is intended to allocate a separate stack for each CPU core in a
multi-core system, each stack being 4096 bytes in size (4096 bytes is a
common size for a stack on many systems).

generally speaking, its considered attribute that specifies alignment,
and declares an array of characters. It combines alignment specification
(aligned (16)) with array declaration  char stack0[4096 * NCPU]; 
to allocate a contiguous block of memory (stack0) that is both aligned
on a 16-byte boundary and sized to accommodate multiple stacks for a
specified number of CPU cores (NCPU).

`4096 * NCPU`  calculates the total size of the array. If NCPU is, for example,
  4, then stack0 would be  4096 * 4 = 16384 bytes (16 KB)

it ensures that the memory allocated for stack0 starts at an address that is
divisible by 16. This is relevant for scenarios where hardware/ software
requires data to be aligned to certain boundaries for efficient memory access,
or to optimize the performance for multi-core systems.

an example might be w/ SIMD instructions in processors which often
require data to be aligned on boundaries such as 16 bytes to perform efficiently.

here's another example of an attribute...
<span class="alt-text">
  void my_function() __attribute__((noreturn));</span>

this `(noreturn)` indicates that my_function does not return to its caller.
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef int my_int_type __attribute__((aligned(4));</span>

this example aligns instances of my_int_type on a 4-byte boundary, and
they can be used to all sorts of things like this.

you can apply multiple attributes to a single declaration...
<span class="alt-text">
  __attribute__((aligned(16), packed)) struct my_struct { ... };</span>

here, aligned(16) aligns the struct on a 16-byte boundary, and packed ensures
that the struct's members are tightly packed without any padding.

these are of course specific to gcc, nevertheless it gives you some fairly
useful utilities like this. it also provides hooks for function entry and exit,
<span class="alt-text">
  void __attribute__((no_instrument_function)) __cyg_profile_func_enter(void *this_func, void *call_site) {
    printf("Entering function %p from %p\n", this_func, call_site);
  }

  void __attribute__((no_instrument_function)) __cyg_profile_func_exit(void *this_func, void *call_site) {
    printf("Exiting function %p to %p\n", this_func, call_site);
  }</span>

when you compile your program with the -finstrument-functions flag, it'll
automatically insert calls to __cyg_profile_func_enter and
__cyg_profile_func_exit  at the entry and exit points of
every function in your program.

other common attributes you might see,

__attribute__((__bounded__))
__attribute__((__format__))
__attribute__((__unused__))
__attribute__((__used__))
