<em>Make sure you are getting the latest iso from your distro's

use your bootable usb as a medium. That way you know if your

Re-discover an existing filesystem
This example uses a (4) partitioned drive, and (2) on a storage drive:
<b>lsblk -f</b>

<em>mount the root partition first - what holds the root filesystem,
                                     then do the rest.</em>

<b>mount /dev/sda4 /mnt</b>
<b>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/part2</b>
<b>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/part3</b>
<b>mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/example</b>
<b>mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/part2</b>
                                     <em>access files will be in /mnt</em>

                                     Chroot into mounted system
<b>artix-chroot /mnt</b>
                                     <em>that'll make subsequent commands as if
                                     in your normal filesystem</em>
bash
<b>sudo su -</b>
                                     <em>`sudo su - `   allows you privilege</em>
<b>vi var/log/pacman.log</b>         find packages that were installed
<b>downgrade</b>                     any troublesome packages

<b>exit</b>         <em>or <b>ctrl d</b></em>
<b>exit chroot</b>
<b>umount -R /mnt</b>
                                     <em>recursive un-mount any time you mounted, and then shutdown</em>
<b>shutdown -h now</b>
