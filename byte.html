You can represent 256 things w/ a byte (8 bits = 1 byte)
The bits in a byte have numbers.
The rightmost bit is bit 0, and the left hand one is bit 7
Those two bits also have names. The rightmost is the least 
significant bit. &emsp; The leftmost within that set of bits
would be the most significant. &emsp; The largest number you can
represent with 8 bits is 11111111, or 255 in decimal notation.
00000000 is the smallest in that set. Logical operators compare

A 32-bit signed integer is an integer whose value
is represented in 32 bits  (i.e.  4 bytes).
Bits are binary, meaning they may only be a zero or a one.
Thus, the 32-bit signed integer is a string of 32 zeros and ones.
The signed part of the integer refers to its ability to represent
both positive and negative values. A positive integer will have its
most significant bit (the leading bit) be a zero,   while a
negative integer will have its most significant bit be  1
Because of this, &emsp; the most significant bit of a signed integer
is typically called the 'sign bit', since its purpose is to denote the
sign of the integer
