&emsp;&emsp;   [read][write][refresh]

&emsp;&emsp; .dram= is a dual inline memory module. It is a physical hardware component with a viscious amount of cycles to maintain.
&emsp;&emsp; Its purpose is to prefetch, move data before it is needed. It is connected to the cpu via channels along the motherboard
&emsp;&emsp;  i.e. memory controller to physical channel.

&emsp;&emsp;    Channel A    Channel B (two memory channels)
&emsp;&emsp; They can accept 32 bits, divided into 4 integrated circuits, so they only read and write 8 of those bits at a time.
&emsp;&emsp; Power goes through the motherboard to its power controller.

&emsp;&emsp; During the Address Input process, the cpu send a 31 bit address.
&emsp;&emsp;   3 of those bits go to the bank group.
&emsp;&emsp;   2 go to the bank, and 16 to the row decoder.

&emsp;&emsp; The remaining 10 are for the column multiplexer.

&emsp;&emsp; PAUSE!: <em>Remember, there's no such thing as an address, however what is real is a bit, if you consider the
&emsp;&emsp; ramifications of voltage in this context as a bit</em>

&emsp;&emsp; Therefore we might say this is all in attempt to describe a bit.

&emsp;&emsp; The wordline comes first. It lies on the bottom layer, directly connected to the transistor and capacitor.
&emsp;&emsp; Applying a voltage to the wordline turns on the transistor and channels to the bitline, but not always as
&emsp;&emsp; in the case of (see below: <em>When a wordline is active</em>).

&emsp;&emsp; This voltage is so that a capacitor can retain a charge of 1 or remain a 0, uncharged. When the wordline
&emsp;&emsp; is off the transistor is off, thus the capacitor is uncharged. When a wordline is active, capacitors of
&emsp;&emsp; that row are active as well. However the bitline remains inactive or else everything in every row and
&emsp;&emsp; column would be active, which would defeat the purpose.

&emsp;&emsp; It is this quilted-pattern cell made of metal-oxide (MOS), a metal-oxide semiconductor that makes this
&emsp;&emsp; process so. The full term for this kind of transistor used is MOSFET (plus the help of the capacitor)

&emsp;&emsp; During the read process, a 31 bit address is sent from cpu to dram.
&emsp;&emsp; 5 bits select a specific bank. Next, all the wordlines must be turned off in that bank, to isolate
&emsp;&emsp; capacitors and precharge ALL the bitlines to 0.5v.  Next, the 16 bit row address turns on a row and then
&emsp;&emsp; all of the capacitors in that row are connected to their bitline.

&emsp;&emsp; If an individual capacitor holds a 1 ~ charged to 1.0v, then some charge flows from the capacitor to these
&emsp;&emsp; 0.5v bitlines, and the voltage on the bitline increases. The sense amplifier then detects the slight change
&emsp;&emsp; on the bitline and amplifies it by pushing the voltage on the bitline up to 1.0v.

&emsp;&emsp; However if a 0 is stored in the capacitor, charge flows from the bitline into the capacitor, and the 0.5v
&emsp;&emsp; bitline decreases. The sense amplifier then detects this change, amplifies it, and drives the bitline voltage
&emsp;&emsp; down to 0 volts (or ground).

&emsp;&emsp; Now the bitlines are 1 or 0 volts corresponding to the stored charge of the capacitors in the active row!
&emsp;&emsp; The state of this row is considered to be "open".

&emsp;&emsp; During the write process,
&emsp;&emsp;  {write command} {address} {8 bits to be written}   are sent from the cpu to dram.
&emsp;&emsp; And like before the bank is selected, the capacitors are isolated, and the bitlines are precharged to 0.5v.
&emsp;&emsp;  Using a 16 bit address, a single row is activated. The capacitors perturb the bitline, and the sense amplifier
&emsp;&emsp; detects this, driving the bitlines to a 1 or 0 (thus opening the row).

&emsp;&emsp; Next, the column address goes to the column multiplexer. Because the write command was sent, the multiplexer
&emsp;&emsp; connects the specific 8 bitines to the write driver, which contains the 8 bits the cpu had sent along the
&emsp;&emsp; data wires and requested to write. These drivers will override whatever was previously happening on said
&emsp;&emsp; bitlines ~ driving each of the 8 bitlines to 1.0v for 1, or 0 volts for 0

&emsp;&emsp; This new bitline voltage overrides the previously stored charges in each of the 8 capacitors in the open row,
&emsp;&emsp; thereby writing 8 bits of data to the memory cells corresponding to the 31 bit address.

&emsp;&emsp; Note that writing and reading happens concurrently.

&emsp;&emsp; During the refresh process, all the rows are sequentially closed, the bitlines are precharged to 0.5v,
&emsp;&emsp; and a row is "opened".

&emsp;&emsp; For this, again, the capacitors perturb the bitlines and the sense amplifiers drive the bitlines and capacitors
&emsp;&emsp; to an "open" row, 1.0v (or down to 0 depending on the stored value of the capacitor).

&emsp;&emsp; This process of row close, pre-charging, opening and sense ampliying happens row after row until ALL of the rows are refreshed.

&emsp;&emsp; When the cpu sends a read or write command to a row that is already open it's called a "page hit".
&emsp;&emsp; This can happen over and over. A page hit skips all of the steps required to open a row, and just uses the 10 bit
&emsp;&emsp; column address to multiplex a different set of 8 columns aka bitlines. This connects them back to the read or
&emsp;&emsp; write driver thereby saving alot of time!... A "row miss" is when the next address is for a different row
&emsp;&emsp; which results in the dram closing and isolating the currently open row, and opening a new row.

&emsp;&emsp; Lastly, there's a couple other optimizations native to dram. By having multiple bank groups the cpu can refresh
&emsp;&emsp; one bank in each bank group at a time, while utilizing the other three. This reduces the overall impact of refreshing.

&emsp;&emsp; For a 'burst buffer', 128 wires connect to 128 bit buffer locations.
&emsp;&emsp;   10 bit column address becomes two different parts.
&emsp;&emsp;   6 bits used for the multiplexer.
&emsp;&emsp;   4 bits for the burst buffer.

&emsp;&emsp; [for a read command], 128 memory cells, bitlines, are connected to the burst buffer using the 6 column bits,
&emsp;&emsp; thereby temporarily loading or caching 128 values into the burst buffer. Using the 4 bits for the buffer,
&meps;&emsp; 8 data locations in the burst buffer are connected to the read drivers, and the data is sent to the cpu.

&emsp;&emsp; By cycling through these 4 bits, all 16 sets of 8 bits are read out, and thus the burst length is 16.
&emsp;&emsp; A new set of 128 bitlines are connected and loaded into the burst buffer.
