&emsp;    I find myself often needing a matrix, or transpositioning
&emsp;    to properly solve a math problem or fit things across the monitor, etc.

&emsp;    I call it a "1 4 7 Matrix". Consider an example where
&emsp;    everything runs vertically. I have to write it as so,
&emsp;    to understand it:

&emsp; -- intended position           -- matrix position

&emsp;       1    2    3                                         1    4    7
&emsp;     
&emsp;       4    5    6                                         2    5    8
&emsp;     
&emsp;       7    8    9                                         3    6    9


&emsp;    Part1, Part2 and Part3, in vertical order- map to the first 3 elements
&emsp;    in the row, a horizontal order. And so on...
&emsp;    We want vertically-running Parts, to appear in intended order,
&emsp;    as the vertical ordering wraps back to the top.
&emsp;    And in this example, they wrap back every 3 elements.
