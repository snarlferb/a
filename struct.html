<div id="struct-anch"><b>struct</b></div>
In C, structures are user-defined data types that group related variables.
in technical terms they would be described as contiguous blocks of memory,
wherein the fields (members) are accessed using offsets.

More specifically, all of its members exist independently of each other,
and they are stored at different memory locations. In a union, all the
members share the same memory space, which means they overlap at the
same memory location. Therefore, a struct is ideal when you need a
receptacle that holds various types of data together (when they
must not overlap at the same memory address)

The following is just to demonstrate how memory is aligned in a struct (Note:
Hold your phone sideways if on mobile, or else the diagram will look disorganized)
<span class="alt-text">
  struct align {
    char a;</span>   <em>// 1 byte</em><span class="alt-text">
    int  x;</span>   <em>// 4 bytes</em><span class="alt-text">
    char b;</span>   <em>// 1 byte</em><span class="alt-text">
  };

  Memory Address:  a = 0x00   0x01   0x02   0x03, x = 0x04
  x = 0x05   0x06   0x07,  b  =  0x08  0x09  0x0A  0x0B
  +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
      a := 1 byte   |(3 bytes padding)|   x := 1 byte   -&gt;
  +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
      x := 1 byte   |  x := 1 byte    |   x := 1 byte   -&gt;
  +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
      b := 1 byte   |(3 bytes padding)|
  +-----------------+-----------------+</span>

1-byte blocks are shown in the diagram. Each of those blocks represents 1 byte of memory,
except for where it shows 3 bytes of padding
a occupies 1 byte at 0x00 (offset 0).
There are 3 bytes of padding to align  x  to 4-byte boundary (represented here by three blocks)
Thus, x occupies 4 bytes, starting at 0x04. b occupies 1 byte at 0x08 and needs 3 more bytes of
padding afterward to maintain proper alignment for the entire struct size (i.e. a multiple of 4)

structs can store any data type:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example {
    float x;
    double y;
  };</span>

using a struct within a function might look like
<span class="alt-text">
  void function(){
    struct example newname;
    struct example *something = &amp;newname;
  }</span>

You can then declare a variable (newname) in this case
that points to x or y in the original struct, and same for
(something), which it now equals the address of member.

When you see this `Object.Member, its referred to as a Member that is
being accessed through the pointer to Object... you use the dot when there's
direct access (used with a struct variable and not a pointer) and the (-&gt;)
arrow operator when its indirect (i.e. when it's being accessed from a pointer already)

Methods: C does NOT have true methods like C++, but you can still call an `Object.function()`,
but only if function is a <b>function pointer</b> <em>inside Object</em> (or more specifically,
inside the struct associated with the instance of Object). Anyway, lets not get ahead of ourselves.

Returning to our struct demonstration, `newname.x` could be declared w/ direct access, and
`something-&gt;x` would have indirect access, seeing as its two levels away from `example`

Because the arrow operator is used to access members of a struct through a pointer
to that struct, its combining a dereference of the pointer with accessing of the struct
member all in one step.
<span class="alt-text">
  List *this = &that;
  this-&gt;num = 6;
  strcpy(this-&gt;name, "Activity");</span>

Whereby `this-&gt;num` is equivalent to `(*this).num`, and the same is true for it in
the proceeding line. In other words, it makes the syntax slightly less involved,
and slightly more specific in regards to indirectly accessing through this member.

For further reading on more situations w/ structs and pointers, such as those that arise when
you want to access things from <a class="reserve" href="vac.html">multiple structs away, go here</a>.

Lets try simply declaring a struct now (lets assume we have a `struct example {}` already)
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example newA;</span>

Here's how you might declare and access members of structures,
this time w/ an array using the dot (.) operator.
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example BarrF[3];
  BarrF[0].x = 101;</span>

`BarrF` is the name of the array. It's a variable that holds a collection of
three `example` structures (from the struct we created in the beginning).

so `BarrF` will hold objects of type `example`. hopefully thats not too
confusing to understand. anything you dont understand you can revisit again.

you can construct a structure as an anonymous struct with a tag, but...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct {
    int x;
    int y;
  } example;</span>

we couldnt directly use typedef to create an alias for an unnamed or
anonymous structure. Therefore, consider the struct we made was named
`struct example {...}`, using typedef we can create an alias for the struct:
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct example example;</span>

lets you declare w/
<span class="alt-text">
  example ex;</span>

as opposed to reusing `struct example ...`, since struct example is a named
structure, `typedef struct example example;` creates an alias "example",
which you can use to declare variables.

and since you've created a typedefined name, it can be used as
a type of some member in a new struct. Note, this is also a common
way typedefined structs are created:
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    example whatever;
  } data;</span>

and since youve already included `typedef`, you can omit the `struct` keyword
in the declaration as we had mentioned.
<span class="alt-text">
  data newA;</span>

<em>or you can access and manipulate its members, like `newA.whatever`, just as
you would with any other struct variable</em>

During definition, you can have the same name used for the struct name and struct tag, e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct example {
    float z;
  } example;</span>

typedef also means that the type (in this case `data`)
is available for use as a "type of function"..
<span class="alt-text">
  data CreateFunction(){
    ...
  }</span>

You can also have what's called a self-referential struct within the struct it's
been defined in, i.e.
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct name {
    struct name *anothername;
  } newname;</span>

The only stipulation is that it must be a pointer. You dont need to make the struct typedef,
but without typedef, you need to always use `struct name` to refer to the type, where as w/ the
typedef, you can use the alias `name` instead of `struct name` thereafter. Type definition is
more common in C than it is in C++. In conclusion, `typedef` in a definition refers to the
type, e.g. `struct name ...`, and a struct tag creates a type alias for, e.g. `name new_variable;`,
or in the case of a nameless struct, the struct tag is then what then provides the self-referential
struct with `name`.

Designated initializers, that we'll be looking at, provide a way of explicitly
intitializing struct members. The following is considered, <b>default order initialization</b>:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct test {
  int a;
  char b;
  } data = {10, 'c'};</span>

That is, the members of the structure are initialized in the order
in which they are declared in the structure definition (a is 10, c is b)
and this one is "explicit order initialization":
<span class="alt-text">
  struct test data = {.b = 'c', .a = 10};</span>

now we should see what it looks like in context:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct Ext {
    int x;
    char *y;
  };

  int main() {
    struct Ext t = {.x = 3, .y = "word"};
    printf("%d, %s\n", t.x, t.y);
    return 0;
  }</span>

C also allows designated initializers, where you can initialize specific
members of a structure by name using this syntax:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct test {
    int a;
    char b;
  } data = {.a = 10, .b = 'c'};</span>

This provides a way to directly access the fields of the structure by name
in the initialization list (note, the dot (.) acts as the designator).
You can do alot with these. Continuing on, lets return to the
beginning of what we learned...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct whatever {
      int x;
      int y;
  };</span>

if you want you can do...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct whatever points[] = {
      {10, 20},
      {30, 40},
      {50, 60}
  };</span>

and you can then declare/access the array elements like normal.
p.s. if you want you can even make it an anonymous structure array,
but lets look at several different examples. first we have...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct whatever {
    int a;
    int b;
  };

  void plop(struct whatever p) {
    }</span>

youve already seen a compound literal before, where the struct literal created
this way is unnamed and temporary. now that example was just for demonsrtation,
lets take a look at another example.. humour me on this..
<span class="alt-text">
  void plop(struct whatever p);</span>

compound literals can be used within function calls, both in the actual function
call and as part of the function prototype or declaration when explaining their usage.
Lets demonstrate by calling `plop`, initializing its members to "1" and "2"...
<span class="alt-text">
  plop((struct whatever){1, 2});</span>

In `{...}` is where the members would presumably be. the temporary struct object
`whatever` only exists within the scope of the expression.

but lets see one more example to be sure <em>(for conventionary reasons, we should use
tagged anonymous structs)</em>
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
  } point;

  int main() {
    point p = {10, 20};
  }</span>

now that we've seen three examples of this in a row, surely you got the idea.
lets go back to basics; Take this structure embedding for example:
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
  } Point;

  typedef struct {
    Point position; // Embedded struct
    int radius;
  } Shape;

  int main() {
    Shape c = {{10, 20}, 5};
    printf("Shape center: (%d, %d), Radius: %d\n", c.position.x, c.position.y, c.radius);
    return 0;
  }</span>

In main, we have an aggregate initialization for `Shape c`. The {10, 20} part represents an
unnamed temporary value that is being used to initialize the `Point` part of the `Shape` struct.

It creates an anonymous temporary object (a Point struct in this case). The "5" initializes the
radius field of the `Shape` struct. It's a simple literal value that doesn't refer to any variable.

<em>We could have put a string, or variable, or any other type within the `{{ }, }` context.</em>

Now lets suppose i have a struct that i want to declare, just for the sake of argument...
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct STable *S</span>

because it is a pointer, you should utilize pointer notation (i.e., -&gt; instead of dot)
when accessing its fields. however if it wasnt a pointer then you would refer to those
instances of it directly with the (.) dot. Also, because `S` is already a pointer type
(struct STable *), you don’t need to add another pointer (*) in the declaration of newMember.
<span class="alt-text">
  struct NewStruct {
      S newMember;
  }</span>

Continuing on, if you learned about function pointers...
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    const char *group_name;
    void (*action)();
  } AutoGroup;</span>

then here is something cool you can do now:
<span class="alt-text">
  AutoGroup auto_groups[] = {
    {"group1", action1},
    {"group2", action2},
    {"group1", action3}
  };</span>

in other words, function pointers let you omit the `(int *)` or type that precedes
the given variable and have a clean-looking string pair (and/or any other way you want)

Theres some common conventions i find myself reusing, such as...
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    Example *d;</span><em>
    // ...</em><span class="alt-text">
  } AppContext;

  AppContext App = {
    NULL,</span><em> /* whatever */
    // ...</em><span class="alt-text">
  };</span>

Declaring and assigning struct members, i often declare `Example *d;` in a function,
And later assign that variable to an object of the same name,  `d = App.whatever`
or directly with `Example *d = App.whatever`. Continuing, the following goes back
to function pointers, i.e. a function pointer of `struct` type:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct fourth (*proc_ptr)(
    const struct fourth *insert,
    float mode,
    const struct ftres *amount,
    float color,
    float width
  );</span>

`struct fourth` is the return type of the function pointed to by `proc_ptr`
The `*proc_ptr` pointer indicates that its a pointer to a function.
`const struct fourth* insert`, is a pointer to `const struct fourth`,
and the rest should be self explanatory.

And next, this is getting back to compound literals and using them in an interesting way.
Say you have a struct called `modern_config`, you can use a compound literal, i.e.
`(type-name){ .field = value, ... }`, to create and return a struct value on the spot:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct modern_config function(struct legacy_config *old) {
    return (struct modern_config){
        // ...
        .flags = 0
    };
  }</span>

And this is equivalent to had we called each individually (statements terminated w/semicolons):
`struct modern_config temp`, `temp.flags = 0` and `return temp`.

An enum is for when you want to create, whats called "enumerated constants"
They define a set of named integer constants, a collection of related values like
states or options. The following structure is efficient in terms of memory, combining
the use of  enum   alongside a union, as only the memory of the <em>current shape</em> type is
allocated at a time (which is the definitive reason for using  unions  in the first place)
<span class="alt-text">
  enum ShapeType {
    CIRCLE,
    RECTANGLE };

  struct Shape {
    enum ShapeType type;
    union {
        struct { int radius; } circle;
        struct { int width, height; } rectangle;
    };
  };</span>

Unions require less memory, however only one member of its allocated memory is used,
as it assigns one common storage space for all of its members.
Regarding nested structs within unions...
<span class="alt-text">
  struct s {double i;} f(void);
  union {
    struct {
      int f1;
      struct s f2;
        } u1;
    struct {
      struct s f3; 
      int f4;
      } u2;
  } g;
    
  struct s f(void) {
    return g.u1.f2;
  }
    </span>/* ... */<span class="alt-text">

  g.u2.f3 = f();</span>

The first line is a fun trick—and a compact way of writing:
<span class="alt-text">
  struct s { double i; };
  struct s func(void);</span>

see here <a class="reserve" href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/tc1.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/tc1.html</a>

Regarding anonymous structs and unions—There apart of the C11 spec, often compiled
w/ -fms-extensions flag , and there are some considerations. Anonymous unions must
be declared within a containing struct or union, where members of the anonymous
struct or union are accessed directly as if they were members of the containing struct or union.
