<em>Note, you can convert any C file to assembly w/    gcc -S hive.c -o hive.s</em>

Lets begin to experiment. We can try to generate an assembly out of a simple C source file.
At that point, we can try mirroring what we began doing by adding the _start to it somewhere...

When you run the compiled binary, it starts executing from the function _start provided by the
C runtime, which performs various initializations, like setting up the stack and environment, etc.
 
After these initializations, the CRT's _start calls main(), the user-defined entry point. 

`Scrt1.o` is the default entry point provided by the C runtime, which gcc links against by default.
If we were to provide our own  _start symbol, it would conflict with this predefined entry point.

Our custom program must be able to bypass this process, and by using the -e _start flag, you tell
the linker to treat your custom _start function as the entry point, instead of the default entry
point provided by the C runtime. We must also construct the Makefile differently by compiling w/
`gcc` specified, telling gcc not to use its default startup files, instead, to use our custom
entry point.

all: hive

hive: hive.o
	gcc -o hive hive.o -nostartfiles -e _start -lc

hive.o: hive.s
	as -o hive.o hive.s

clean:
	rm -f hive hive.o</span>

-nostartfiles  tells gcc not to use the standard startup files (like Scrt1.o)
-e _start  sets the entry point to  _start (custom entry point)
     Without this flag, the linker expects to start at  main
-lc  links against the C standard library (libc)
     which is necessary for  printf
