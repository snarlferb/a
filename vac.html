<b>Pointers and the Vacuum of Space</b>

This is a tricky thing to grok at first, so i'll try to illustrate it like this...
Hopefully you already read and learned about how the dot &amp; arrow operators
work as pointers...

Consider we created the following structs to begin w/
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
    char *buffer;
  } Anar;

  typedef struct {
    Anar nar;
  } V;

  typedef struct {
    V *obj
  } Database;</span>

`Anar` contains a member, `buffer`, which is a character array.
`V` contains a member, `nar` which is of type `Anar`.
`Database` contains a member, `obj`, which is a pointer to `V`.

To access the buffer member of `Anar` (which is nested within `V`) and then within Database,
you need to handle the pointers and structs in the right way....

Consider we have a `database` which is a pointer to a Database struct, possibly like this...
<span class="alt-text">
  Database *database = (Database *)malloc(sizeof(Database));
  if (database == NULL) {
    perror("Failed to allocate memory for Database");
    return 1;
  }</span>

Which is for allocating and initializing a `Database` instance. Here's some things we might do...
`database-&gt;obj` accesses the `obj` member of `Database`...

It has a member `nar` of type `Anar`.
`(*database-&gt;obj).nar` accesses the `nar` member of the `V` structure.
`(*database-&gt;).nar.buffer` then accesses the `buffer` member of the `Anar` structure

It sounds more complicated than it is, since its describing multiple scenarios towards the final composite object,
however you can take it from the last scenario, and sortve trace the steps backwards so to speak...

The last scenario, we said we could take that `(*database-&gt;obj)` to access the `buffer` member of the `Anar` struct.
Consider  *database-&gt;obj.nar.buffer   Here’s how the C compiler would interpret it:

`database-&gt;obj`  is a pointer to  V.
`database-&gt;obj.nar`  is  invalid syntax.

(-&gt;) is used for accessing members from a pointer to a struct. And we want to use `nar`.
We have to correctly access `buffer` of the `Anar` struct, and `nar` after that, you need to dereference
`database-&gt;obj` to get the `V` struct. Also it can be confusing because of the order that pointers occur in
changes how you access them in the long run. As you begin understanding this, it should make sense.

So the correct syntax in that particular situation would be:
<span class="alt-text">
  (*database-&gt;obj).nar.buffer
</span>

At some point you might even consider simplifying access with a temporary variable
<span class="alt-text">
  V *exac = *database-&gt;obj;</span>

Which would allow you to use it as `exac-&gt;nar.buffer`, and is just one example of something you might do.
Sometimes its a matter of convenience; That is, our structure is part of an original struct that we make a `*member.
And by using `*member` you can directly reference its data without copying it around or dealing with dereferencing multiple times.

So for example, when you access the field from `MyType mylist`, you're directly referring to that mylist data. Using `MyType *reflist`
in your code allows you to work with this data directly without additional dereferencing. Consider the (&amp;) address-of operator and the
(*) dereference operator can be used in various contexts involving pointers and variables, such as how they're used w/ <em>pointers to pointers.</em>
Take your time to work out the quarks w/ these situación aw'kwards, as it'll help w/ access-members and pointers alike.

One last point, if the dot operator is already accessing a member, for example, `(*database.obj)`, to get the address of `obj`, you need to apply
the address-of operator to the whole expression, so it looks like `(&amp;(*database.obj)`

In C/C++ you can have a reference to a pointer, or a pointer to a pointer, but you CANNOT have a pointer to a reference, or reference to a pointer to a reference.
That is to say, a reference is like a one-time usecase alias for an existing variable (reference type or address-of, whatever..), and a pointer is a kind of pointer object
that must be dereferenced before it can be used/accessed again. Once you can see the precedence levels of everything, and how they extend away from (.), it should be fairly
simple to understand. So you can think of the dot (and pointer) as a period that accesses members within the scope (individual levels) of an object, or it points to its memory.
As we move out from the original dot, if you use the dereference operator (*) its as if you are navigating out from that solar system into a specific memory address, or you are
doing a rudimentary (-&gt;) operator to indicate that youve left the homeworld. It’s like saying, "I want to record different regions of space, and I also want it to be crystal
clear when I have left the homeworld, whereby I can go further on to Alpha Centauri, and other known places (addresses) in the vacuum of space. And each time we leave a new place,
we'll also de-reference and/or reference that place, if its important to know what address it is in space."

This kind of sentiment is true as well for understanding dynamic memory, and the effect it has on heap memory when you use `malloc` and `free`, in that you are thinking about
how you allocate and release memory from a specific location, much like charting new territories in space. When you use malloc, you’re carving out a new road map in space, and
when you call free, you’re returning to the homeworld, making sure it is available for the future XD, avoiding memory leaks and ensuring efficient resource management.
