I have made a new assembly page, but its still under construction, les you view it in the meantime. If youve come here by accident,
you can continue on to the next page to learn about <a class="reserve" a href="page10.html">bit manipulation and attributes</a>.

I'm still debating how i want to present the information here. We'll likely go over assembly/assembler, disassembly, instructions,
registers, immediate values, subroutines, control flow, atomic operations, call stack, directives, non-section directives, headers,
segments, sections, relocation, general architectural information, etc.

You interpret this <span class="alt-text">instruction [reg/val]-&gt;[destination]</span> reading from left to right. While in Intel
syntax, the destination goes in place of the [reg/value], so it appears as: <em>instruction [destination]&lt;-[reg/value]</em>
<span class="alt-text">
  .global _start</span>               <em># This is the start (equivalent of `int main`)</em><span class="alt-text">
  hello_str:
    .ascii "12345\n\0"</span>           <em># A string of characters (in this case numbers)</em><span class="alt-text">
  .text</span>                        <em># This is a "section", where the code will reside</em><span class="alt-text">
  _start:</span>                      <em># Start execution here</em><span class="alt-text">

    movq $0, %rdi</span>              <em># Exit Code (success)</em><span class="alt-text">
    syscall</span>

In this example, `hello_str` does not have an explicitly declared section, so it is placed in the current section, which defaults
to  .text, if no section directive was specified before hello_str. This is not ideal because data should be explicitly placed in
the  .data section or another appropriate section rather than mixing with code.

Typically, in GNU Assembly, if theres no section, the assembler assumes the  .text  section, and this demonstrates what sections
are usually associated w/ what. hello_str (a label)  serves as a reference to the memory location where "12345\n\0" is stored.
An ASCII string is a sequence of bytes; And we explicitly add the null char (\0), the null character being a sentinel value that
denotes the end of the string. This demonstrates the difference between `ascii`, versus  `asciz` which is ASCII with the zero or
null termination happening automatically.

In assembly, when you use a dollar sign w/ a symbol, e.g. `$counter`, it represents the immediate value of the address of that symbol.
This means it's using the address of the memory location `counter` rather than the content that's stored at that memory location.
When used without a dollar sign, it represents the content stored at the memory location. You'll have to know what each keyword
is, what its for and how its used. For example you have directives, symbols, flags, string literals, operands (i.e.
labels, registers, values, memory addresses, etc), instructions, conditional codes, macros, a type attribute
(which specifies the nature of symbols), etcetera.

If you want to see more examples that elaborate on whats going on, see <a class="reserve" href="asm2.html">this page on assembly</a>

Makes sense so far, right?.. I think ive mentioned before, that you compile code with -o and it also specifies the name of the program.
And, you can also use -c which lets you compile it to an object file, <em>but without linking</em>. When you create an assembly program,
you have to do this explicit object/linking step yourself, which can be accomplished without using -c. In GCC, -o not only specifies the
name of the output executable, but, when used with "AS" in the following example, it specifies the name of the output object file too.
<span class="alt-text">
  AS = as</span>                      <em># Assembler</em><span class="alt-text">
  LD = ld</span>                      <em># Linker</em><span class="alt-text">
  CFLAGS = -g</span>                  <em># Flags</em><span class="alt-text">

  hive: hive.o
    $(LD) -o hive hive.o

  hive.o: hive.s
    $(AS) -o hive.o hive.s

  clean:
    rm -f hive hive.o</span>

Now just to give a brief explanation of some things from our example before we unload pandora's box...

`.global _start` is a directive that makes `_start` visible to the linker, indicating that `_start` is the entry point of the program.

`_start` is the label defining the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the operating system begins execution here.

The beginning sections define/organize various parts of the program into distinct areas that in turn say how the program is stored in memory.
Segments refer to parts of a program that are used for organizing and managing different types of code and data. They are a broader concept
that describe the executable image itself and how memory is managed or mapped into the address space for a process in memory, how code and
data are laid out in it.

For example, there is a text segment that appears in the final executable that holds the machine code instructions. When the program is
loaded into memory, the text segment is where the code is placed. When you assemble and link your program, the `.text `section is
translated into machine code and placed into the text segment of the executable file. An example of a section is `.strtab` (String Table)
which contains string data (functions and variables) used by symbols in the symbol table, which is a data structure used in compilers and
linkers to manage and track symbols (such as variable names, function names, and other identifiers)

When making a syscall, the syscall number is placed into the %rax register. This number tells the kernel which system call to execute.
You can interact with syscalls inside of assembly on linux. There is a table from syscall_64.tbl. This file defines the system call
table for 64-bit systems. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific system call, including its ID (number), name, and other attributes,
connecting the system call number to the actual function implemented in the kernel.

For example, the "sys_read" entry point refers to the specific function that handles the read system call. It allows user-space programs to
read data from a file descriptor into a buffer (`read(fd, buf, count)` is the user-space version of the function)  Other syscalls are:
"1" associated w/ "write", "2" associated w/ "open", "3" associated w/ close, etc. At the time of writing this, there are approximately
456 system calls that are to be placed in the %rax register.

The syscalls.h header file typically declares the prototypes for system calls and sometimes includes necessary macros and definitions.
The DEFINE_SYSCALLx macros are used in the kernel source code to define the entry points for system calls. The "x" in DEFINE_SYSCALLx stands
for the number of arguments the syscall takes (e.g., DEFINE_SYSCALL0, DEFINE_SYSCALL1, etc.). The macros expand to define the actual function
that implements the system call and associate it with its corresponding syscall number.
<span class="alt-text">
  #define DEFINE_SYSCALL1(name, type1, arg1) \
  asmlinkage long sys_##name(type1 arg1)

  DEFINE_SYSCALL1(getpid, void);</span>

This defines a system call getpid that takes no arguments and returns the process ID. When making a syscall, a file descriptor would be
passed into the %rdi register. Here's how some common syscall arguments map to registers: for example, making a <em>read</em> syscall, %rax
contains the syscall number, %rdi (first argument) would contain the file descriptor, %rsi (second argument) would contain the buffer's address
(buffer pointer), and %rdx (third argument) would contain the size or flags (the number of bytes to read)

Speaking of, in the context of x86 assembly and architecture, there's a flags register, the EFLAGS (Extended Flags) register, which is used to
hold the status and control flags for the processor. The associated flags are specific to x86 (e.g. `clc` or clear carry flag, which is useful
for preparing the status flags for subsequent arithmetic or logical operations, ensuring that the carry condition is explicitly handled for the
needs of the program). These flags can potentially be used in an assembly instruction. The GAS (GNU assembler) or whatever assembler you choose
will provide the instructions to manipulate the said-additional features of the architecture.

Mastering low-level system architecture and code analysis requires more than just knowing how to write instructions; it involves a deep
understanding of the underlying CPU architecture, interactions, CPU front end, how data is structured and managed, and how it interprets
and how it executes code. Each of these architectural features—that is, registers, selectors, descriptors, stack frames, opcode encoding,
data types/structures, paging structures, condition codes, exceptions and interrupts, CPUID, global, local and interrupt descriptor tables
and task state segments, etcetera—is what you'd need to know to understand x86 and assembly in general.

I'll just very briefly discuss a couple of what those that i said. The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a data structure used by the CPU to
map interrupts and exceptions to their corresponding handler routines. When an exception or interrupt occurs, the CPU looks up the IDT to find
the address of the appropriate handler that should be executed...

Global descriptor tables define global memory segments and their attributes, while local descriptor tables define local memory segments,
specific to individual tasks. The task state segment is a special segment that contains information about a task’s state. This includes CPU
register values, stack pointers, and other information needed to resume a task after a context switch. We wont be going over context switches.

RISC-V employs a flat memory model, which simplifies the CPU's memory management architecture. In a flat memory model, there is no need for
segment descriptors or tables to define memory regions. All processes work with a single, consistent memory space, with isolation handled purely
through paging or other virtual memory mechanisms.
<h3>___ Summary ___</h3>
These <em>segments</em> are of course different to the sections or segments (parts of an executable or object file) that we are going to be
referencing in the context of ELF format. Instead, <b>these</b> segments are part of the CPU’s memory management and protection mechanisms.
Theres alot more to x86 architecture that we wont be going over here. Its best that we dont turn this into a bottomless pit of information,
and focus on how to read and write assembly code, as well as how to debug code on your own.

Disassembly is the process of converting machine code back into assembly language. A disassembler reads the binary machine code and
translates it into human-readable assembly instructions. The assembler ("as" in GNU toolchain, masm, nasm, etc.) converts this assembly
into machine code, producing an object file (`.o` extension). An object file contains information such as the sections we talked about,
including headers with metadata, a symbol table for linking and debugging, relocation information for address adjustments, debugging
information for source code mapping, and a string table for names used in the object file.

Even though an object file contains machine code with the aforementioned context, it isn't fully ready to run because the addresses of
variables, functions, and other resources aren't yet fully determined. That is, it does not define an entry point, and does not have
a program header yet. It does contain unresolved symbols and relocation entries, which arent resolved until the linking phase.

This is where <em>relocation</em> comes into play. We'll talk more about this later. For now, lets go into the contents of an
assembly file, then afterwards i will touch on the relationships between assembly, disassembly and the ELF file structure.

Disassembling your assembly or compiled code shows you both the instructions and the machine code that implements them.
Not only are there hundreds of different x86 instructions, there can be dozens of different machine code encodings for
a given instruction (more on this later)

  ASM    MACHINE CODE    DESCRIPTION
  add    0x03 ModR/M     Add one 32-bit register to another
  mov    0x8B ModR/M     Move one 32-bit register to another
  mov    0xB8 DWORD      Move a 32-bit constant into register eax
  ret    0xC3            Returns from current function
  xor    0x33 ModR/M     XOR one 32-bit register with another
  xor    0x34 BYTE       XOR register al with this 8-bit constant

<h3>___ Registers ___</h3>
General-purpose registers (64-bit Registers) may look like:  %rax (accumulator register), %rbx (base register), %rcx (counter register),
and %rdx (data register). Additional 64-bit Registers are: %rsi (source index register), %rdi (destination index register),
%rbp (base pointer register) and %rsp (stack pointer register)

%rax, we already know can be used to specify the system call number (e.g., the write system call number is 1). It is also used to hold
the return value of a function or system call.  %rdi  is used to pass the first argument to functions or system calls. For example,
in the write system call, %rdi specifies the file descriptor (e.g., 1 for stdout). Likewise, %rsi is used to pass the second
argument and  %rdx passes the third argument to functions or system calls.

16-bit and 8-bit Versions (lower part of the corresponding 32/64-bit register):
- %ax, %ah, %al: Accumulator (full, high, low)
- %bx, %bh, %bl: Base (full, high, low)
- %cx, %ch, %cl: Counter (full, high, low)
- %dx, %dh, %dl: Data (full, high, low)
- ... and so on.

Special-purpose registers:
%rip: Instruction pointer (contains the address of the next instruction to be executed)
%rsp: Stack pointer (points to the top of the stack)
%rbp: Base pointer (used to point to the base of the current stack frame)
%flags: Flags register (contains various condition code flags)
%rflags: Full register including flags
%r8 - r15: Additional general-purpose registers

Preserved registers or "callee-saved registers" (according to the x86_64 System V ABI or Application Binary Interface) are responsible
for saving the original values of these registers at the beginning of the function and restoring them before returning.
This ensures that the caller's values in these registers remain unchanged after the function call:
- %rbx: Used for general-purpose calculations and as a base register
- %r12: A general-purpose register, often used for temporary storage in functions.
- %r13: Another general-purpose register, similar to %r12.
- %r14: A general-purpose register.
- %r15: A general-purpose register.

In contrast, caller-saved registers (or volatile registers) are %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %rsi, %rdi, %r8 to %r11. The caller must save these
registers if it needs their values preserved across function calls because the callee is free to modify them.

Segment registers:
%cs: Code segment
%ds: Data segment
%ss: Stack segment
%es, %fs, %gs: Extra segments (often used for additional purposes like thread-local storage)

Suffixes like   b,  w,  l, and  q  denote the size of the data being operated on: "b" (byte) is 8 bits, "w" (word) is 16 bits, "l" (long) is 32 bits,
"q" (quad) is 64 bits. <b>Load/Store instructions</b>, for example:  "movb"  moves a byte of data, "movw"  moves a word of data,  "movl" moves a double
word (or long) of data, and "movq" moves a quad word of data.

Other data movement variants are the "movs" instruction for moving and optionally sign-extending or zero-extending data from one location to another.
In simpler terms its used to move data between strings (we'll explain the terms above later)

Control Transfer Instructions:  jmp (unconditional jump),  je, jne, jg, etc. (conditional jumps),  call (to call a procedure/subroutine),
ret (to return from a procedure)

Conditional Move Instructions:  cmov (conditional move based on flags)

A <b>Procedure</b>, "subroutine", or what you might consider a "function", transfers control to a specified address and saves the return
address, allowing the program to return to the original point after the subroutine completes its execution. This procedure is called `print_hello`

Note: I'll be referring to things as a <em>subroutine</em> in the context of assembly, as the term function (funct) is associated with the encoded fields
of RISC instructions, as we may be focusing on RISC-V architecture at some point.
<span class="alt-text">
  print_hello:</span>
    <em># Write string to stdout</em><span class="alt-text">
    mov $1, %rax
    mov $1, %rdi
    lea msg(%rip), %rsi
    mov $13, %rdx
    syscall
    ret</span>

The call instruction handles pushing the return address, e.g. (call print_hello). It invokes a subroutine from within _start or another subroutine,
where the ret instruction is used at the end of the subroutine. It pops the return address from the stack and jumps to that address, effectively
returning control to the point right after where the call was made. So, you do not need to manually push or pop the return address onto the
stack when using call and ret instructions.

`push`  and  `pop`  are used when you need to manually manage data on the stack. These instructions are useful for saving and restoring the
values of registers, passing parameters to functions, or managing local variables.

Unlike higher-level languages, assembly doesnt have a builtin called a structure or union. Instead, you manually manage memory and access
fields using "offsets". Control flow in assembly often involves manipulating flags and using conditional jumps to change the execution path.

Arithmetic Instructions are:  add,  sub,  div,  imul (signed),   mul (unigned multiplication)

Packed decimal operations are essential in applications where exact decimal representation is important. Unlike binary arithmetic, which can
introduce rounding errors in decimal calculations, packed decimal arithmetic ensures precision by maintaining the decimal format within operations.

Packed decimal operands, also known as Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) operands, handle decimal arithmetic operations in a way that's directly aligned w/
decimal digits. Each decimal digit is stored in a 4-bit nibble (half of a byte). This allows two decimal digits to be stored in a single byte.
For example, the decimal number "93" would be stored as 0x93 in packed decimal format, where 9 is represented by 1001 and 3 by 0011 in binary.

BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) is a binary-encoded representation of integer values where each digit of a decimal number is represented by its own
binary sequence. Packed BCD as mentioned has two decimal digits per byte, where unpacked BCD has each decimal digit stored in a separate byte.
Operations on packed decimal formats often involve specific instructions designed to handle the peculiarities of decimal arithmetic:

AAD (ASCII Adjust AX Before Division), i.e. `aad` instruction adjusts the AX register to prepare for a division of BCD numbers. It converts
packed BCD in AX to binary before performing a division. If you have packed BCD digits in AX and you need to divide these digits, AAD converts
them to binary form so that a division can be performed correctly.

The key difference between packed and unpacked operations is in how the data is organized and processed within CPU registers. In an unpacked
approach, each pair of integers is processed sequentially, one by one, rather than all at once. In a packed operation, multiple data elements
(integers, floating-point, etc.) are stored side by side in a single register, and the operation is applied to all of them at once.

So instead of loading and storing data one element at a time, SIMD loads and stores multiple elements at once (we'll talk about SIMD later)

Floating-Point Instructions:  fld, fstp (load and store, for floating-point values),  fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv (floating-point arithmetic)

Floating Point Registers are used by the x87 floating-point unit (FPU) to perform floating-point arithmetic. In x86 architecture, the FPU is depicted
by the x87 FPU stack, which consists of 8 registers (st(0)—st(7)) which are eight 80-bit wide floating-point registers. The x87 registers work as a
stack, where operations typically push and pop values to and from the stack. Instructions like fld (load), fadd (add), fsqrt (square root), and
others manipulate these registers.

For historic value, <em>x87</em> refers to the specific co-processor model number, the 8087, which was the first FPU (released in 1980) designed to
work alongside the 8086/8088 CPUs. The 8087 handled floating-point arithmetic that the base 8086/8088 CPU did not directly support.  P.S.
advanced features like out-of-order execution, superscalar architecture, and dynamic branch prediction didnt come out until much later.

Logical Instructions:   bitwise AND is `and`,  bitwise OR is `or`,  bitwise XOR is `xor,  bitwise NOT is `not`

Bit manipulation and common idioms:  shl, shr (shift left/right),  rol, ror (rotate left/right)

XOR (`xor`) can also be used to set the value of (zero'ing out) a register to 0, and is a common idiom in assembly. `xor` is a logical
operation that doesn’t depend on the previous value of the register. This means that using `xor` to zero a register can break data
dependencies, allowing for better pipelining in modern CPUs.

Setting a register to -1 (all bits set to 1) is often done with (`or`) or (`not`). The `test` instruction is similar to `and` but doesn’t
store the result, just sets the flags. It’s often used to check if a register is zero:
<span class="alt-text">
  test %rax, %rax
  jz zero_label</span>    <em># Then jump if zero</em>

Multiplication by a power of 2 can be done more efficiently with a shift left operation.
<span class="alt-text">
  shl $3, %rax</span>  <em># Multiply %rax by 8 (2^3)</em>

These instructions are used to sign-extend values from smaller to larger registers.
<span class="alt-text">
  mov %al, %eax</span>  <em># Zero-extend 8-bit value to 32 bits</em><span class="alt-text">
  cbw</span>            <em># Sign-extend %ax to %eax (convert byte to word)</em>

For an 8-bit "signed" integer, the range is from -128 to 127. The number -12 (decimal) is represented in binary as 11110100; When extended
to 16 bits using sign extension, the result would be  11111111 11110100 (the most significant bit is "1", indicating a negative number).
The original 8 bits are preserved, and the additional 8 bits are filled with 1s to maintain the negative value. 

Sign extension is used when you need to preserve the sign (positive or negative) of a value when converting it from a smaller size to a larger size.
We mentioned sign extension earlier. There are other instructions its performed with like   cwd (convert word to doubleword)  cdq (convert doubleword
to quadword) cqo (convert quadword to octoword)  You can move with a sign extension, i.e.  movsx (move with sign extension)  movsxd (move with sign
extension doubleword)  Sign extension is always used with signed data.

Truncation, or reducing the size of a value by discarding higher-order bits can lead to loss of data. That is, in the same way we filled the
additional 8 bits with ones, the same is true for zero extension, but using "zeroes" instead. Zero extension (e.g. movzx) converts a smaller
unsigned value to a larger size, and thus it must always be used with unsigned data.

`nop` (no operation) does nothing, consuming a single clock cycle. It is used for padding instructions, often in aligning code
or creating delay loops.

Comparison Instructions:  cmp  to compare two operands

String Instructions are:  cmps (compare strings), scas (scan string),

Stack Instructions are:  push (push data onto the stack), pop (pop data from the stack)

<h3>___ Calling Convention ___</h3>
For modern Linux systems (on x86-64 architecture) the calling convention used is the System V AMD64 ABI,
The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9 in that order.

Integer or pointer return values are returned in RAX. The stack is aligned to 16 bytes before a call, and
the return address is pushed by the call instruction, so the stack is 8 bytes off from 16-byte alignment
upon entering a function. Functions must maintain this alignment by adjusting the stack pointer if they
push an odd number of 8-byte values.

<h3>___ Register Preservation ___</h3>
Callee-saved registers that must be preserved (if used): RBX, RBP, R12, R13, R14, R15.
Caller-saved registers that can be modified: RAX, RCX, RDX, RDI, RSI, R8, R9, R10, R11.

<h3>___ Call Stack ___</h3>
The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called stack frames ("frames" for short), wherein each frame is the data associated with
one call to one function. The frame contains: (1) the arguments given to the function, (2) the function's local variables, and (3) the address
at which the function is executing.

When your program is started, the stack has only one frame (that of the function "main"). This is called the initial frame or the outermost frame.
Each time a function is called, a new frame is made. Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation is eliminated.
If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for the same function. The frame for the function in which execution is actually occurring
is called the innermost frame. This is the most recently created of all the stack frames that still exist

There's a conceptual idea about how the stack grows from the *"bottom-&gt;up"*... Higher memory addresses are at the "bottom" of the stack, and
lower memory addresses are at the "top." *push* meaning it goes onto the stack, *pop* means it gets removed, hence <em>"popped-off the stack"</em>
—which means it gets popped off from the "TOP" of the stack—where the lower memory addresses are at... Thus the stack pointer then gets incremented
(increased in value) to point to the new top element, where memory is descending, as we've so aptly illustrated.

Each architecture has a convention for choosing one of those bytes, whose address serves as the address of the frame. Usually this address is kept
in a register called the <em>frame pointer register</em>, while execution is going on in that frame.

The memory allocator (malloc, free, etc. in C) can check if there is enough space to expand the heap. The OS can enforce limits on stack size (e.g.,
via ulimit settings in Unix-like systems) to prevent the stack from growing indefinitely. If a collision is imminent, the OS can terminate the process
or raise an error to prevent corruption.

The compiler generates code that manages stack allocation and deallocation for function calls. It inserts instructions to adjust the SP register and
manage the stack frames. The memory allocator handles requests for dynamic memory allocation. The internal mechanism of our memory allocator keeps
track of free and allocated memory blocks within the heap using data structures such as free lists (data structures used by memory allocators to manage
and organize available memory blocks of specific sizes within the heap) or binary trees.

When a program requests memory, the allocator finds a suitable free block, marks it as allocated, and returns a pointer to the program. When memory is
freed, the allocator marks the block as free and may merge adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.

The OS manages the overall memory space for each process. It provides system calls like brk and sbrk to increase the size of the heap. Modern systems
may use more advanced mechanisms like mmap for large allocations. The OS ensures that the heap and stack do not collide by imposing limits on their
growth and monitoring their usage.

There's two main kinds of interrupts, "software" and "hardware" interrupts... software are identified by the "int" assembly instruction... and these trigger
instructions within the program (e.g. system calls/request from os)... hardware are strictly generated by external devices or internal processor events...
such as (keyboard input, timer events, disk operations)... InterruptServiceRoutines (IRS) are special routines that handle interrupts.
<h3>___ More Instructions ___</h3>
Atomic Operations:
These are some of the instructions used for parallel and atomic operations. They provide mechanisms for ensuring atomicity, synchronization, and
ordering of memory operations in multi-threaded or multi-processor environments.

lock: This prefix is used to ensure atomicity when performing operations on memory locations shared between multiple processors.

Atomic Compare-and-Swap Instructions:
cmpxchg: Performs a compare-and-swap operation on a memory location.
cmpxchg8b: Performs an 8-byte compare-and-swap operation on a memory location.
cmpxchg16b: Performs a 16-byte compare-and-swap operation on a memory location (available on 64-bit CPUs).

Atomic Increment and Decrement Instructions:
lock inc: Atomically increments the value of a memory location.
lock dec: Atomically decrements the value of a memory location.

Atomic Exchange Instructions:
xchg: Exchanges the contents of a register with a memory location atomically.
xadd: Atomic exchange and add operation. Exchanges the contents of a register with a memory location and then adds the original value of the
memory location to the register.

Fence Instructions:
mfence: Memory fence instruction ensures that all memory operations before the fence are globally visible before any memory operations after the fence.
lfence: Loads fence instruction ensures that all load memory operations before the fence are globally visible before any memory operations after the fence.
sfence: Stores fence instruction ensures that all store memory operations before the fence are globally visible before any memory operations after the fence.

Unique Instructions, e.g., lea: Load Effect Address computes the address of a memory location and loads it into a register, but it does not access the
memory at that address. It performs address calculation and is often used for arithmetic operations that involve memory addresses.
<h3>___ More Registers ___</h3>
SIMD or (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Vector Registers, for example:  64-bit MMX (mm0-mm7) i.e. MultiMedia eXtensions  perform operations on multiple
integer values simultaneously and in parallel, such as w/ packed bytes, words, and doublewords.

SIMD instructions have their own specific opcodes and prefix bytes in x86 machine code, and they represent operations like adding, multiplying, shifting,
etc., but applied to multiple data elements at once. For example, the instruction paddw (Packed Add Word) adds eight 16-bit integers from one XMM register—
to eight 16-bit integers in another XMM register (XMM registers are 128 bits wide, 128 divided by 16 is 8). The machine code encoding might look something
like (66 0F FD /r), where "66" is the prefix, "0F FD" is the opcode, and "/r" specifies the registers involved.

SIMD Floating-Point Vector Registers are used for SIMD operations, which can perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously as well.
Examples include 128-bit XMM registers (used with SSE and SSE2 instructions), 256-bit YMM registers (used with AVX and AVX2 instructions), and 512-bit
ZMM registers (used with AVX-512 instructions) (e.g., %xmm0–%xmm15, %ymm0–%ymm15, %zmm0–%zmm15)

Instructions like addps (Add Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values), mulps (Multiply Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values), vaddps
(Vector Add Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values) operate on these registers.

You can also convert between flaoting point and integer values, e.g. cvttps2dq converts packed single-precision floating-point values into packed 32-bit integers.

Address Space Identifier (ASID) registers are used to handle address space identification, differentiating processes or context. ASID allows the TLB to hold
multiple address spaces simultaneously, tagging each TLB entry with an ASID. This means that the TLB can retain entries for different processes or address
spaces without invalidating them during a context switch.

Control Registers are used to control various aspects of the CPU's operation, such as enabling protected mode or paging. Examples include CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4.
There's more to control registers of course, for example, CR3 can hold the base address of the page directory or page table (for virtual address translation)
When you change the value of CR3, it effectively switches the page directory being used, which typically necessitates a TLB flush to ensure that address
translations are correct for the new page directory.

Debug Registers are used primarily for debugging purposes. They allow setting hardware breakpoints and control debugging features. Examples include DR0, DR1,
DR2, DR3, DR6, and DR7.

Model-Specific Registers are used to control and report on various CPU-specific features, such as performance monitoring, power management, and system
configuration. They are often accessed using the rdmsr and wrmsr instructions.

Table Registers include the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), Local Descriptor Table (LDT), Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and Task Register (TR)

Test Registers (TR6 and TR7) are less commonly used but can be important for testing, debugging and system programming tasks.

PMCs (Performance Monitoring Counters) are for tracking events such as CPU cycles, instructions retired, cache hits/misses, etc.
The registers are   rdpmc  and  rdmsr/wrmsr  instructions to access performance counters and MSRs (Model-Specific Registers)

MSRs are accessed using the  rdmsr  and  wrmsr  instructions  but they require privilege levels that are generally available only to the kernel or
higher-level system software. This is because writing to MSRs can affect the system's stability and security, so access to these instructions is
restricted to prevent misuse.

<h3>___ Directives ___</h3>
Directives provide additional information to the assembler, helping with data allocation, defining sections, etc...
<span class="alt-text">
  .section .text
  .global  _start</span>

This makes the _start symbol is visible to the linker. As a user-defined label, _start helps you identify and reference the location of the
entry point, as a symbol, _start allows the linker to recognize and use this location as the program’s entry point. On its own, a label does
not affect the linking process or make the symbol visible outside the module where it is defined.
<span class="alt-text">
  .section .data
  msg:     .asciz "Hi!ve hollow"</span>

When you explicitly declare the .data section using .section .data, the string "Hi!ve hollow" will be stored in the data segment of the program.
The .data section is typically used for initialized, static data (like strings or global variables). The label  `msg` refers to its memory location.

Lets describe each section, including user-defined labels, etc. The Data Section is reserved for initialized data, constants, and possibly
space for uninitialized data (BSS). For example in,
<span class="alt-text">
  .section .data
  mylabel:
    .long 1, 2, 3, 4</span>

mylabel is the label for an array with (.long directive) 32-bit integers, and in this context it initializes the data w/ 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4

.data   defines a section for initialized data
.bss    defines a section for uninitialized data (BSS is Block Started by Symbol)
.text   defines a section for the program's code

The Text Section (Code Section) contains the executable code. A function prologue prepares the function for execution. It saves register values that need
to be preserved (push). It also allocates space for local variables and function parameters. The "function epilogue" cleans up after the function execution.
It deallocate space for local variables and parameters (add esp), restores saved register values (pop) and returns from the function (ret).
<h3>___ Non-Section Directives ___</h3>
.if, .elif, .else, .endif, are conditional directives that allow you to include or exclude parts of the assembly code based on certain conditions.
.set  defines a symbol with a value, similar to .equ, but can be redefined within the same assembly source.
.align, aligns the data or code to a specified boundary. This is useful for optimizing memory access or satisfying some required width.
.offset  is used to calculate the offset of a symbol relative to a base address, often in conjunction with linker scripts.
.global  declares symbols as global, making them accessible from other files or modules. For example, .global _start  makes the _start symbol available
for linking;   .local  marks a symbol as local to the file, meaning it is not visible outside of it (restricted to the current file)
.extern  declares symbols defined in other files (external and defined in another file)
.comm  declares a common symbol, which is a global symbol that is allocated space in memory. The linker will resolve this symbol.
.equ   defines a symbolic constant. For example, .equ BUFFER_SIZE, 1024 creates a symbolic constant named BUFFER_SIZE with the value 1024.
.type  sets the type of a symbol. Commonly used with ELF file formats to define symbol types (e.g., STT_FUNC for functions).
.size  specifies the size of a symbol. This is useful for debugging information and certain linker operations.
.file  sets the current file name for debugging information, helpful for tools that process debug information.

.macro and .endm,  define and end macros... and  .rodata  is associated w/ readonly data, much like the `const` keyword
.weak  declares a symbol as weak, meaning it can be overridden by a symbol of the same name with higher precedence.
.previous   reverts to the previous section settings; Useful when you have multiple sections in the same file and want to switch to an earlier section.
`.hidden _internal_symbol` is an example of marking a symbol as hidden from the dynamic linker, preventing it from being exposed in shared libraries.

You can use directives like .byte, .word, .long, and .quad to define sequences of memory with specific initial values. Each directive is used to reserve
and initialize a block of memory with data of different sizes.

.space  is for reserving a `n` amount of space in the section it's used (typically .bss for uninitialized data) and is a more general directive to operand
<span class="alt-text">
  .section .bss
  fd: .space 8</span>

This reserves 8 bytes (quadword) for the file descriptor... There's many reasons you might want to reserve something. In this case, you store the
file descriptor for later use. This can be useful if you need to keep the file descriptor around for multiple operations, wherein it needs to be accessed
or modified in different parts of the program, or maybe you just want to clearly delineate the logic this way.
<h3>___ More Assembly/Instruction ___</h3>
In many situations it may be necessary to use the Scale, Index, and Base (SIB) byte when you need to access memory locations based on a combination of
registers and constants. An example is for arrays and multi-dimensional data, where the SIB byte provides a direct and efficient way to calculate the
address of elements based on their index and the size of each element. This is important when dealing with large datasets or when performance is critical.
<span class="alt-text">
  movl (%ebx, %esi, 4), %eax</span>

Here, %ebx (base address) is a displacement that points to the start of the array, %esi is the index register (index into the array), and 4 is the
scale factor (multiplied by the size of each integer (4 bytes)). The value is moved into %eax. This instruction effectively loads a 32-bit value from the
address calculated by  base + index * element_size  into the %eax register.

Many instructions use a single byte for the opcode. For example, the mov instruction can use the 0x8A opcode for moving data between a register and memory.
Some instructions require a two-byte opcode. For example, the mov instruction with a 0x0F prefix indicates a two-byte opcode is needed for certain operations.
The MOD R/M byte follows the opcode (whether one or two bytes) to specify the details of the operands. For example, for the instruction  `mov %ebx, %eax`,
the MOD R/M byte specifies that both operands are registers. The MOD R/M byte is just a part of the instruction encoding that specifies how operands are
addressed in an instruction.

More specifically ModR/M specifies what the source and destination are. Separating it into its constituent parts (MOD, REG, R/M): MOD (2 bits) which acts as
a selector (a field within a byte(s) that specifies a particular option or operand) is indicative of whether R/M is treated as a plain register or a memory
address. It also determines if there is additional data, such as displacement bytes for memory addressing. REG specifies the register involved in the
operation, which is usually the destination register and determines the column in the ModR/M table. And a final register "R/M", which usually specifies the
source register, and selects the row of the ModR/M table.

This is just one part of the machine code instruction format, which refers to the binary encoding of instructions, including prefix bytes, opcodes, etc.
Each part also contributes to several micro-operations performed by the CPU. Please look online to learn more about this including the CPU instruction cycle,
microcode, microprograms, microinstructions and anything else that may be relevant.
<h3>___ Executable and Object File Information ___</h3>
When you run the objdump command on a compiled binary, you're inspecting the low-level details of the binary, including its disassembled code.
And it will show disassembly information, such as for a given function e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  0000000000400b00 &lt;do_something&gt;:
  ... (disassembly of the function)
    400be0:       48 89 e5        mov    %rsp,%rbp
    400be3:       55             push   %rbp</span>

The line with `0000000000400b00 &lt;do_something&gt;` indicates the starting memory address of the function do_something (within the binary),
w/ the hex address 0x400b00 showing where the function begins in the program's memory space. The proceeding lines are machine instructions translated
into assembly language. The left side (400be0, 400be3) shows the offset within the function where each instruction occurs, relative to the start
of the function. The right side shows the machine code as hexadecimal bytes (e.g., 48 89 e5) and the corresponding assembly instruction (e.g.,
mov %rsp,%rbp). The objdump command can give you alot of information about a program, including a comprehensive view of the binary's structure
and contents.
<h3>___ ELF File Structure ___</h3>
The next question we need to ask is, "How is this data structured, and how is it executed?" An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file serves as
a container for compiled code and data, allowing programs to be executed by the operating system. It contains sections for code, initialized and
uninitialized data, and metadata needed for execution. For executable files, it includes details such as the entry point now, where the program
starts, and instructions for loading and linking dynamically. Essentially, an ELF file provides the structure necessary for a program to run,
whether as a standalone executable or as part of a larger application.

The ELF header is conceptually placed at the beginning before everything, so you wont actually see it. Instructions like mov, call, jmp, etc.,
directly manipulate program state and control flow, and are tied to specific segments loaded into memory. Sections are named blocks like .text,
.data, .bss, .rodata, .symtab, .strtab, etc. and the ELF header helps make sure that these sections are correctly placed and managed during program
execution.

The Program Header describes a segment within the ELF file, for how portions of the file should be loaded into memory, and a Section Header defines
attributes for each section within the ELF file.

Instructions like mov -0x20(%rbp), %rax or mov 0x98(%rax), %rax are accessing specific memory locations relative to the base pointer (rbp) or other
registers (rax, rdx, etc.). The offsets and addresses used in these instructions (a negative offset in this case) align with the segment and section
definitions in the ELF structure (Program Header and Section Header), for the proper memory map/access during execution.

The ELF file contains a symbol table that lists all the symbols referenced or defined within the file. Each symbol entry has a name, type
(function, variable, etc.), and potentially a section index indicating where it's defined. It may also contain one or more relocation sections.

Many symbol table entries are associated with a section. This association tells the linker (during program creation) where to find the symbol's
definition within the object file. The section index within the symbol table entry points to the corresponding section header in the object file,
allowing the linker to resolve references between symbols across those files. These sections hold entries that specify how to adjust symbol
references based on their relocation type. You wont typically see them directly in a segment/section view when looking at functions, etcetera.

Sections like `.text` provide information about individual instructions, or rather the encoded assembly instructions that we grazed by, each associated
with individual bytes that represent a machine code instruction. The `.data` is a subsection with initialized data (as opposed to uninitialized data in
`.bss`), where as `.rodata` contains read-only data like string literals and constant tables. Many sections can be found in an ELF file, and it depends
on the program and how it was compiled, or rather the specific flags/options it was being compiled with.

<h3>___ Relocation ___</h3>
Relocations are entries within the ELF file that instruct the linker/loader on how to adjust symbol addresses at runtime. While these entries might
reference the symbol itself, they are distinct from the symbol information that you see. For example, say we have an ELF formatted file generated
from a program called <em>hive</em> that references a function do_something defined in a shared library  mysharedlib.so. The symbol table in  <em>hive</em>
would have an entry for do_something, and there might be a relocation section indicating that references to this symbol needs to be adjusted by a
certain value when loaded into memory.

Each entry in a relocation table contains information such as: location, type and symbol. Location refers to the address within the section where
the relocation should be applied, specified by the offset field. An offset is the address within the executable where the symbol reference needs to
be adjusted.

The relocation type is part of the info field and tells the linker how to process the relocation, a key part of how the info field is used.
Some relocation types might involve adding the symbol's value to the offset. `info` encodes the relocation type (like, adding a base address,
absolute address or relative address) and an index into the symbol table (symbol index). <em>Some relocation types might involve adding the symbol's
value to the offset</em>. The symbol index within the info field points to the symbol table entry from which the value will be used for relocation.

Linking is the process that's responsible for resolving placeholders and offsets using the information in the relocation tables (to produce the
executable w/ all of its addresses set). Function calls and variable references contain placeholders or offsets. Offsets are relative distances
from a certain reference point, typically used within the same module. When generating machine code, the compiler inserts this placeholder (often
a zero or an address that can be easily identified as needing replacement) wherever the actual address of a function or variable is needed.

These placeholders indicate unresolved references, which must be replaced with the addresses during the linking stage. Sometimes, especially for
internal references within the same object file, the compiler uses offsets (relative addresses) as opposed to the absolute addresses. Offsets can
indicate the distance from a certain base address (like the start of a function) to where the actual code or data resides.

Relocation is thus the process of adjusting these addresses so that the code can run properly at the point where everything is put together.
So to reiterate, first the compiler translates source code into object files. Each object file contains machine code, symbol definitions (functions and
variables it defines), and symbol references (functions and variables it needs). These symbols aren’t fully resolved; their addresses are placeholders.

The linker takes multiple object files and combines them into a single executable or shared library. During this process, the linker resolves all symbol
references by updating the placeholders with actual memory addresses. The linker updates the machine code with these addresses so that function calls and
variable accesses point to the correct locations. Therefore, the relocation tables in the object files guide the linker on where adjustments are needed.

After relocation, only the addresses are present in the final executable. Here's some extra points to consider: We know sections in an ELF file are
defined in the section header table. Each section has an address field called sh_addr in its section header. The purpose of these addresses is to
facilitate linking and relocation processes. sh_addr, is where the section should reside in the virtual address space of the process when loaded into
memory, sh_offset (file offset) is the position within the ELF file where the section's data starts. The section header has several fields like this.
