By using efibootmgr, you can add a boot entry, telling the UEFI firmware to load the kernel directly,
whereupon it then points to your kernel on the ESP, making the kernel act as both the bootloader and
operating system.. Therefore, using efibootmgr with an EFI-stubbed kernel can act as a minimalist
alternative to a bootloader, provided you’re comfortable with the trade-offs in functionality.

efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/sdX --part Y --label "MyLinux" --loader /vmlinuz-linux --unicode "root=/dev/sdXY initrd=\initramfs-linux.img" --verbose</span>

This setup is generally faster and simpler if you’re running a single OS (no dual-boot) and are
comfortable managing kernel parameters yourself. However, this approach can be less flexible than a
traditional bootloader, (GRUB, etc.) as it lacks built-in tools for things like fallback kernels,
recovery options, and easy configuration changes. You would typically need to manually update
the EFI boot entry if you update the kernel too.
