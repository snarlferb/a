&emsp;&emsp; <em>There are many many distributions of linux.
&emsp;&emsp; Once you know which you'd like to install you should
&emsp;&emsp; go about finding that distro's installation page.
&emsp;&emsp; You can also take these instructions as a solid
&emsp;&emsp; foundation on what you need to do.</em>

&emsp;&emsp; Init System:  w/ runit,  however dinit or S6 may be preferred for a
&emsp;&emsp; different init utilizing a service directory structure, OpenRC uses
&emsp;&emsp; SysVinit-esque service management through scripts, found inside  /etc/rc.d

&emsp;&emsp; Initial Boot: The installer (if present) often sets the newly installed system
&emsp;&emsp; as the default boot option in the BIOS or UEFI firmware (we'll talk about BIOS/UEFI)
&emsp;&emsp; This means that when the computer is powered on, it will attempt to boot
&emsp;&emsp; the installed Linux system. The installer may configure the init system
&emsp;&emsp; to start specific services during the initial boot process. These services
&emsp;&emsp; might include essential system components like networking, file systems,
&emsp;&emsp; and package management. The installer typically installs a bootloader,
&emsp;&emsp; like GRUB, that is responsible for loading the kernel and init system
&emsp;&emsp; when the computer starts.

&emsp;&emsp; file system: fat32 is the most compatible file system but
&emsp;&emsp; we'll be exploring the use of other file systems as well
&emsp;&emsp; note, make sure everythings plugged in during this time

&emsp;&emsp; **Important**
&emsp;&emsp; The term  "BIOS" is often colloquially used, and can mean either UEFI or PC BIOS...
&emsp;&emsp; BIOS or UEFI is sometimes considered a 1st-stage bootloader, while GRUB is the 2nd...
&emsp;&emsp; (U)EFI System Class 1 and Class 2, has a BIOS compatible mode called "Legacy BIOS" or
&emsp;&emsp; "CSM" (short for Compatiblity Support Module), which makes the UEFI behave like a PC BIOS.
&emsp;&emsp; UEFI System Class 3, the standard since around 2020, no longer has a CSM...
&emsp;&emsp; If you plan to make an MBR (dos) partition table, than you should be in
&emsp;&emsp; "Compatible Support Module" or "Legacy Mode", but if you're going w/ a
&emsp;&emsp; GPT partition table you should be in "UEFI" boot mode.

&emsp;&emsp; **[Enter]BIOS**
&emsp;&emsp; Once computers on,
&emsp;&emsp; Press the “Del”
&emsp;&emsp; or “F1” , “Esc”, “Fn 2”
&emsp;&emsp;    or “F10”, “F2” or “F12”
&emsp;&emsp; to open the BIOS...
&emsp;&emsp; “Alt” is sometimes hidden settings.
&emsp;&emsp; select the "usb" boot option in BIOS

&emsp;&emsp; || NOTE: Make sure you have internet/wifi
&emsp;&emsp; || Your keyboards last config WILL persist
&emsp;&emsp; || Save bluetooth, sound, etc devices until afterwards

&emsp;&emsp;                     ```you may need to run `swapon --show` to see if a swap partition is being used
&emsp;&emsp;                     wherein you can run `swapoff /dev/sda5`, or whichever one it listed for you```

&emsp;&emsp;                     When it comes to sectors, fdisk will automatically convert human-readable formats e.g. (30GB) into sectors
&emsp;&emsp;                     and you can then accept the default value ([Enter]) for the last sector.
&emsp;&emsp;                     However, in case you do have to calculate both sectors, if you see something like "2048-1465149134", that represents the "start-end" sectors
&emsp;&emsp;                     available... What i do is specify "2048" as my First sector, and then i calculate the amount i want to manually specify (starting w/ 1GB)
&emsp;&emsp;                     and using this conversion principle:... `1GB * 1024MB = 1024MB/GB,  1024 * 1024 = 1048576KB/MB,  104857 * 1024 = 107373568 bytes/KB, 
&emsp;&emsp;                     107373568 / 512 bytes = 209714`  ... and thats what youd specify as the Last sector for the first partition... for the second partition,
&emsp;&emsp;                     you take the TOTAL amount you want to specify (31GB), calculate the conversion factor in the same way we did... And that would be the
&emsp;&emsp;                     Last sector for the second partition, where you specify the First sector as "one step, or sector" greater than the Last sector of the
&emsp;&emsp;                     first partition.

<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; o</span>            ```to create a new empty MBR partition table```
&emsp;&emsp;                     Creating a separate boot partition depends on the system's boot method (BIOS/UEFI) and partitioning scheme (MBR/GPT). For BIOS-based systems
&emsp;&emsp;                     using MBR partitioning GRUB embeds its core image in the MBR gap, so a separate boot partition isn't necessary. On UEFI-based systems using
&emsp;&emsp;                     GPT partitioning, there's an EFI System Partition (ESP) for storing boot loaders. GRUB for UEFI systems is installed to the ESP, which typically
&emsp;&emsp;                     requires only a few hundred megabytes of space. It's essential to allocate sufficient space for the ESP and other partitions based on your system
&emsp;&emsp;                     requirements. GRUB will automatically install to the ESP on UEFI systems. For BIOS-based systems, while a separate boot partition isn't typically
&emsp;&emsp;                     required, ensuring adequate space for the core image is necessary, so creating a small boot partition for it is recommended.

<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1</span>
&emsp;&emsp;                     Assuming this is for your boot partition, mkfs.vfat will create a FAT32 if said partition is large enough.
&emsp;&emsp;
&emsp;&emsp;                     ```EFI system partitions hold EFI boot loader files and related data, so it doesn't typically contain a traditional filesystem like Ext4, and..
&emsp;&emsp;                     instead it usually has a FAT32 filesystem. Therefore you dont run `mkfs.ext4` on that partition if you've created an "EFI system"...
&emsp;&emsp;                     and you run the following    `mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1` which is a more explicit version of mkfs.vfat```

&emsp;&emsp;                     Keep in mind, we'll be creating things in the `/mnt` directory because that is where we are recreating the directory structure of the system.
&emsp;&emsp;                     Since /mnt is the mount point for e.g. /dev/sda3, it treats this as the base for the root filesystem, where the rest of the root directory structure will belong,
&emsp;&emsp;                     so you HAVE to do `/mnt` first  BEFORE you <b>mkdir</b> and <b>mount</b> the others.```
<span class="alt-text">

&emsp;&emsp;                     Use  `umount`  to unmount if something went wrong.

&emsp;&emsp;                     <em>NOTE: You do not always receive a confirmation after using a command. You can of course test whether a command runs successfully or not w/ e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; (man runit && echo "command ran successfully") || echo "Error: command was not executed"</span>
<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; ls -lap | more</span>
&emsp;&emsp;                     its worth learning how to use `more` and `less` commands for viewing by pages, e.g.  man dir | less
&emsp;&emsp;                     Try `command --help` for available options, as --debug  or  -v --verbose results</em>

&emsp;&emsp;                     *Network*:
&emsp;&emsp;                     For ethernet you simply do this:
<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; sv start connmand</span>
&emsp;&emsp;                     And for Wifi, you do the following...
<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; rfkill unblock wifi</span>
<span class="alt-text">
&emsp;&emsp; ip addr show</span>
&emsp;&emsp;                     Here you'll see the interface name e.g. "wlan0", an IPv4 address, "inet 192.168.1.10/24" and a broadcast address "brd 192.168.1.255", etc
<span class="alt-text">

&emsp;&emsp;                     "Connman" and "NetworkManager" seem to interfere w/ each other.. So consider using "connmanctl" first to connect,
&emsp;&emsp;                     and ignore the NetworkManager until the end, where you can presumably use connmand or nmcli (NetworkManager's controller).

&emsp;&emsp;                     you have no way to get on the internet, and that includes accessing through ethernet. So download/or configure every-
&emsp;&emsp;                     thing you need thats internet related before hand or youll have to start from the beginning again.

&emsp;&emsp;                     for `iw` &amp; `wpa_supplicant`, which you dont have initially until you download those packages that require them.
&emsp;&emsp;                     <em>some people find networkmanager gives them trouble, but for me its always connman and the others that dont work</em>
