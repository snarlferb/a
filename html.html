What a URL is composed of:
<span class="alt-text"> 
      protocol://host:port/path#anchor</span>          "anchor" is also known as fragment
    
      You can add a Query String, additional parameters for the request, often in the form of key-value pairs.
      It starts with (?), for example, in       `https://example.com/page?name=Bob&amp;age=30`

      A "slug" is a URL-friendly version of a resource identifier, typically derived from a title or name.
      It’s used to create readable and SEO-friendly URLs (search engine optimization). Slugs often replace
      spaces with hyphens, and they may convert uppercase letters to lowercase. P.s. Everything that comes
      after "port" in the URL is case sensitive.

The following command is deployed          for auditioning said html page:<span class="alt-text">

    python -m http.server</span>           <em>it'll say, "..serving you the
                                           http on server 8000" or something</em>
 desktop  url                              localhost:8000/page.html
 private ip (needed on mobile)             192.168.0.1:8000/page.html
 port forwardng requires your public ip    but thats a different topic

First off, what do we call these things...

<span class="alt-text">&lt;!-- This is a comment - that will not be displayed in the published html page --&gt;</span>

<b>Tags</b> mark up existing content to define its presentation; they're also used in the creation of elements <em>(as we demonstrate towards the end)</em>
They are always surrounded by angled brackets. As such, you enclose said elements w/ an opening and closing tag.
<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;</span>

<b>Attributes</b> provide additional information about HTML elements. They are included in the opening tag.
Attributes come in several flavors: Quoted or unquoted attributes (w/ a string or numeric value), as well as boolean attributes. 
<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>

<b>Elements</b> consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag. If the tag doesn't have an end tag, it can be a void element.
This is a regular element:
<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;p&gt;Yadayada yada&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The following is a void element. Void elements do not have any content or end tag, as they are considered <em>self-closing</em>:
<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image"&gt;</span>

Anchors are used in html to jump you around in the document.
Here's an example of a link that is also an anchor:
<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;a href="func.html#void-anch"&gt;Hyperlinked words that are anchored now&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div id="eg-anch"&gt;Example words for other end of the link&lt;/div&gt;</span>

I will go over what those tags and attributes mean.

 &lt;HTML&gt; ... &lt;/HTML&gt;           Encloses the entire document and
                                overrides other filetyping mechanisms
 &lt;TITLE&gt; ... &lt;/TITLE&gt;          The title of the document
 &lt;BODY&gt; ... &lt;/BODY&gt;           Encloses the body of the document.
 &lt;Hn&gt; ... &lt;/Hn&gt;               Section heading, n=1 (biggest) to 6
 &lt;PRE&gt; ... &lt;/PRE&gt;             Encloses block of text to be shown verbatim.
  
&lt;A NAME="..." HREF="URL"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;
                             Creates a link (HREF) or (NAME) or both. They are attributes, NAME being an example
                             of something deprecated in HTML5 (which may or may not be true, test it for yourself)
                             &lt;a&gt; being for hyperlinks, and &lt;href&gt; to specify the URL of the link.

&lt;DIV&gt; ... &lt;/DIV&gt; is a block-level container element used to group other
                             elements and apply/manipulate sections. So &lt;div&gt; may be called a tag
                             (when referring to the specific parts) and an element (when referring to the whole structure).
  <span class="alt-text">&lt;div id="main-content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

"main-content" is the value assigned to the id attribute. This value serves as the unique identifier for that particular element.

Inlined image<span class="alt-text">
  &lt;IMG ALIGN="..." SRC="URL" ALT="..."&gt;</span>
                              Inserts an image from SRC, or text
                                from ALT if the image can't be used.
                                ALIGN is one of top, middle, bottom (default)
Text flow
 &lt;br&gt;                         Force a line break
 &lt;p&gt;                          Add a paragraph break
 <hr>                         </hr>Horizontal rule (pseuedo page break)(i sometimes prefer a dotted line)
